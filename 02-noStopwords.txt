streaked spotted speckled males mating females dream angel God said me Jacob I replied Here I am Look up he said see all males mating flock streaked spotted or speckled I have seen all Laban has done you I am God Bethel where you anointed pillar made solemn vow Me Now get up leave this land once return your native land Rachel Leah replied Do we have any portion or inheritance left our father house we not regarded by him outsiders Not only has he sold us but he has certainly squandered what paid us Surely all wealth God has taken away from our father belongs us our children So do whatever God has told you Then Jacob got up put his children his wives on camels he drove all his livestock before him along all possessions he had acquired Paddan aram go his father Isaac land Canaan Now while Laban out shearing his sheep Rachel stole her father household idols Moreover Jacob deceived Laban Aramean by not telling him he running away So he fled all his possessions crossed Euphrates headed hill country Gilead On third day Laban informed Jacob had fled So he took his relatives him pursued Jacob seven days overtook him hill country Gilead But night God came Laban Aramean dream warned him careful not say anything Jacob either good or bad Now Jacob had pitched his tent hill country Gilead when Laban overtook him Laban his relatives camped there well Then Laban said Jacob What have you done You have deceived me carried off my daughters like captives war Why did you run away secretly deceive me without even telling me I would have sent you away joy singing tambourines harps But you did not even let me kiss my grandchildren my daughters goodbye Now you have done foolish thing I have power do you great harm but last night God your father said me careful not say anything Jacob either good or bad Now you have gone off because you long your father house But why have you stolen my gods I afraid Jacob answered I thought you would take your daughters from me by force If you find your gods anyone here he shall not live presence our relatives see yourself if anything yours take back Jacob did not know Rachel had stolen idols So Laban went into Jacob tent then Leah tent then tents two maidservants but he found nothing Then he left Leah tent entered Rachel tent Now Rachel had taken Laban household idols put them saddlebag her camel sitting on them Laban searched everything tent but found nothing Rachel said her father Sir do not angry I cannot stand up before you I am having my period So Laban searched but could not find household idols Then Jacob became incensed challenged Laban What my crime he said what sin mine have you so hotly pursued me You have searched all my goods Have you found anything belongs you Put here before my brothers yours they may judge between two us I have been you twenty years now Your sheep goats have not miscarried nor have I eaten rams your flock I did not bring you anything torn by wild beasts I bore loss myself you demanded payment from me what stolen by day or night heat consumed me by day frost by night sleep fled from my eyes Thus twenty years I have served your household fourteen years your two daughters six years your flocks you have changed my wages ten times If God my father God Abraham Fear Isaac had not been me surely by now you would have sent me away empty handed But God has seen my affliction toil my hands last night He rendered judgment But Laban answered Jacob These daughters my daughters these sons my sons these flocks my flocks Everything you see mine Yet what can I do today about these daughters mine or children they have borne Come now let us make covenant you I let serve witness between you me So Jacob picked out stone set up pillar he said his relatives Gather some stones So they took stones made mound there by mound they ate Laban called Jegar sahadutha Jacob called Galeed Then Laban declared This mound witness between you me this day Therefore place called Galeed also called Mizpah because Laban said May LORD keep watch between you me when we absent from each other If you mistreat my daughters or take other wives although no one us remember God witness between you me Laban also said Jacob Here mound here pillar I have set up between you me This mound witness this pillar witness I will not go past this mound harm you you will not go past this mound pillar harm me May God Abraham God Nahor God their father judge between us So Jacob swore by Fear his father Isaac Then Jacob offered sacrifice on mountain invited his relatives eat meal after they had eaten they spent night on mountain Early next morning Laban got up kissed his grandchildren daughters blessed them Then he left return home Jacob also went on his way angels God met him When Jacob saw them he said This camp God So he named place Mahanaim Jacob sent messengers ahead him his brother Esau land Seir country Edom He instructed them You say my master Esau Your servant Jacob says I have been

they said We went your brother Esau now he coming meet you he four hundred men him great fear distress Jacob divided his people into two camps well flocks herds camels He thought If Esau comes attacks one camp then other camp can escape Then Jacob declared O God my father Abraham God my father Isaac LORD who told me Go back your country your kindred I will make you prosper I am unworthy all kindness faithfulness You have shown Your servant Indeed only my staff I came across Jordan but now I have become two camps Please deliver me from hand my brother Esau I am afraid he may come attack

During night Jacob got up took his two wives his two maidservants his eleven sons crossed ford Jabbok He took them sent them across stream along all his possessions So Jacob left all alone there man wrestled him until daybreak When man saw he could not overpower Jacob he struck socket Jacob hip dislocated they wrestled Then man said Let me go daybreak But Jacob replied I will not let you go unless you bless me What your name man asked Jacob he replied Then man said Your name will no longer Jacob but Israel because you have struggled God men you have prevailed Jacob requested Please tell

Penuel he limping because his hip Therefore this day Israelites do not eat tendon which socket hip because socket Jacob hip struck near tendon Now Jacob looked up saw Esau coming toward him four hundred men So he divided children among Leah Rachel two maidservants He put maidservants their children front Leah her children next Rachel Joseph rear But Jacob himself went on ahead bowed ground seven times he approached his brother Esau however ran him embraced him threw his arms around his neck kissed him they both wept When Esau looked up saw women children he asked Who these you Jacob answered These children God has graciously given your servant Then maidservants their children approached bowed down Leah her children also approached bowed down then Joseph Rachel approached bowed

insisted No please If I have found favor your sight then receive this gift from my hand indeed I have seen your face like seeing face God since you have received me favorably Please accept my gift

seventeen years old he tending flock his brothers sons his father wives Bilhah Zilpah he brought their father bad report about them Now Israel loved Joseph more than his other sons because Joseph had been born him his old age so he made him robe many colors When Joseph brothers saw their father loved him more than any them they hated him could not speak kind word him Then Joseph had dream when he told his brothers they hated him even more He said them Listen this dream I had We binding sheaves grain field suddenly my sheaf rose stood upright while your sheaves gathered around bowed down mine Do you intend reign over us his brothers asked Will you actually rule us So they hated him even more because his dream his statements Then Joseph had another dream told his brothers Look he said I had another dream this time sun moon eleven stars bowing down me He told his father brothers but his father rebuked him said What this dream you have had Will your mother brothers I actually come bow down ground before you his brothers jealous him but his father kept mind what he had said Some time later Joseph brothers had gone pasture their father flocks near Shechem Israel said him not your brothers pasturing flocks Shechem Get ready I am sending you them I am ready Joseph replied Then Israel told him Go now see how your brothers flocks faring bring word back me So he sent him off from Valley Hebron when Joseph arrived Shechem man found him wandering field asked What you looking I am looking my brothers Joseph replied Can you please tell me where they pasturing their flocks They have moved on from here man answered I heard them say Let us go Dothan So Joseph set out after his brothers found them Dothan Now Joseph brothers saw him distance before he arrived they plotted kill him Here comes dreamer they said one another Come now let us kill him throw him into one pits We can say vicious animal has devoured him Then we shall see what becomes his dreams When Reuben heard this he tried rescue Joseph from their hands Let us not take his life he said Do not shed his blood Throw him into this pit wilderness but do not lay hand on him Reuben said this so he could rescue Joseph from their hands return him his father So when Joseph came his brothers they stripped him his robe robe many colors he wearing they took him threw him into pit Now pit empty no water they sat down eat meal they looked up saw caravan Ishmaelites coming from Gilead Their camels carrying spices balm myrrh on their way down Egypt Then Judah said his brothers What profit will we gain if we kill our brother cover up his blood Come let us sell him Ishmaelites not lay hand on him he our brother our own flesh they agreed So when Midianite traders passed by his brothers pulled Joseph out pit sold him twenty shekels silver Ishmaelites who took him Egypt When Reuben returned pit saw Joseph not there he tore his clothes returned his brothers said boy gone What am I going do Then they took Joseph robe slaughtered young goat dipped robe its blood They sent robe many colors their father said We found this Examine see whether your son robe or not His father recognized said my son robe vicious animal has devoured him Joseph has surely been torn pieces Then Jacob tore his clothes put sackcloth around his waist mourned his son many days All his sons daughters tried comfort him but he refused comforted No he said I will go down Sheol mourning my son So his father wept him Meanwhile Midianites sold Joseph Egypt Potiphar officer Pharaoh captain guard About time Judah left his brothers settled near man named Hirah Adullamite There Judah saw daughter Canaanite man named Shua he took her wife slept her So she conceived gave birth son Judah named him Er Again she conceived gave birth son she named him Onan Then she gave birth another son named him Shelah Chezib she gave birth him Now Judah acquired wife Er his firstborn her name Tamar But Er Judah firstborn wicked sight LORD so LORD put him death Then Judah said Onan Sleep your brother wife Perform your duty her brother law raise up offspring your brother But Onan knew offspring would not belong him so whenever he would sleep his brother wife he would spill his seed on ground so he would not produce offspring his brother What he did wicked sight LORD so He put Onan death well Then Judah said his daughter law Tamar Live widow your father house until my son Shelah grows up he thought He may die too like his brothers So Tamar went live her father house After long time Judah wife daughter Shua died When Judah had finished mourning he his friend Hirah Adullamite went up his sheepshearers Timnah When Tamar told Your father law going up Timnah shear his sheep she removed her widow garments covered her face veil disguise herself sat entrance Enaim which on way Timnah she saw although Shelah had grown up she had not been given him wife When Judah saw her he thought she prostitute because she had covered her

when he pulled his hand back his brother came out she said You have broken out first So he named Perez Then his brother came out scarlet thread around his wrist he named Zerah Meanwhile Joseph had been taken down Egypt where Egyptian named Potiphar officer Pharaoh captain guard bought him from Ishmaelites who had taken him there LORD Joseph he became successful man serving household his Egyptian master When his master saw LORD him made him prosper all he did Joseph found favor his sight became his personal attendant Potiphar put him charge his household entrusted him everything he owned From time he put Joseph charge his household all he owned LORD blessed Egyptian household on account him LORD blessing on everything he owned both his house his field So Potiphar left all he owned Joseph care he did not concern himself anything except food he ate Now Joseph well built handsome after some time his master wife cast her eyes upon Joseph said Sleep me But he refused Look he said his master wife me here my master does not concern himself anything his house he has entrusted everything he owns my care No one this house greater than I am He has withheld nothing from me except you because you his wife So how could I do such great evil sin against God Although Potiphar wife spoke Joseph day after day he refused go bed her or even near her One day however Joseph went into house attend his work not single household servant inside She grabbed Joseph by his cloak said Sleep me But leaving his cloak her hand he escaped ran outside When she saw he had left his cloak her hand had run out house she called her household servants Look she said this Hebrew has been brought us make sport us He came me so he could sleep me but I screamed loud I could When he heard me

sport me but when I screamed help he left his cloak beside me ran out house When his master heard story his wife told him saying This what your slave did me he burned anger So Joseph master took him had him thrown into prison where king prisoners confined While Joseph there prison LORD him extended kindness him granting him favor eyes prison warden warden put all prisoners under Joseph care so he responsible all done prison warden did not concern himself anything under Joseph care because LORD Joseph gave him success whatever he did Some time later king cupbearer baker offended their master king Egypt Pharaoh angry his two officers chief cupbearer chief baker imprisoned them house captain guard same prison where Joseph confined captain guard assigned them Joseph he became their personal attendant After they had been custody some time both these menthe Egyptian king cupbearer baker who being held prison had dream on same night each dream had its own meaning When Joseph came them morning he saw they distraught So he asked officials Pharaoh who custody him his master house Why your faces so downcast today We both had dreams they replied but there no one interpret them Then Joseph said them Dont interpretations belong God Tell me your dreams So chief cupbearer told Joseph his dream my dream there vine before me on vine three branches budded its blossoms opened its clusters ripened into grapes Pharaoh cup my hand I took grapes squeezed them into his cup placed cup his hand Joseph replied This interpretation three branches three days Within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head restore your position You will put Pharaoh cup his hand just you did when you his cupbearer But when goes well you please remember me show me kindness by mentioning me Pharaoh he might bring me out this prison I kidnapped from land Hebrews even here I have done nothing which they should have put me this dungeon When chief baker saw interpretation favorable he said Joseph I too had dream There three baskets white bread on my head top basket all sorts baked goods Pharaoh but birds eating them out basket on my head Joseph replied This interpretation three baskets three days Within three days Pharaoh will lift off your head hang you on tree Then birds will eat flesh your body On third day which Pharaoh birthday he held feast all his officials their presence he lifted up heads chief cupbearer chief baker Pharaoh restored chief cupbearer his position so he once again placed cup Pharaoh hand But Pharaoh hanged chief baker just Joseph had described them his interpretation chief cupbearer however did not remember Joseph he forgot all about him After two full years had passed Pharaoh had dream He standing beside Nile when seven cows sleek well fed came up from river began graze among reeds After them seven other cows sickly thin came up from Nile stood beside well fed cows on bank river cows sickly thin devoured seven sleek well fed cows Then Pharaoh woke up but he fell back asleep dreamed second time Seven heads grain plump ripe came up on one stalk After them seven other heads grain sprouted thin scorched by east wind thin heads grain swallowed up seven plump ripe ones Then Pharaoh awoke realized dream morning his spirit troubled so he summoned all magicians wise men Egypt Pharaoh told them his dreams but no one could interpret them him Then chief cupbearer said Pharaoh Today I recall my failures Pharaoh once angry his servants he put me chief baker custody captain guard One night both chief baker I had dreams each dream had its own meaning Now young Hebrew there us servant captain guard We told him our dreams he interpreted them us individually happened us just he had interpreted I restored my position other man hanged So Pharaoh sent Joseph who quickly brought out dungeon After he had shaved changed his clothes he went before Pharaoh Pharaoh said Joseph I had dream no one can interpret But I have heard said you when you hear dream you can interpret I myself cannot do Joseph replied but God will give Pharaoh sound answer Then Pharaoh said Joseph my dream I standing on bank Nile when seven cows well fed sleek came up from river began graze among reeds After them seven other cows sickly ugly thin came up I have never seen such ugly cows all land Egypt Then thin ugly cows devoured seven well fed cows there first When they had devoured them however no one could tell they had done so their appearance ugly had been before Then I awoke my dream I also saw seven heads grain plump ripe growing on single stalk After them seven other heads grain sprouted withered thin scorched by east wind thin heads grain swallowed seven plump ones I told this dream magicians but no one could explain me this Joseph said Pharaoh dreams Pharaoh one same God has revealed Pharaoh what He about do seven good cows seven years seven ripe heads grain seven years dreams have same meaning Moreover seven thin ugly cows came up after them seven years so seven worthless heads grain scorched by east wind they seven years famine just I said Pharaoh God has shown Pharaoh what He about do Behold seven years great abundance coming throughout land Egypt but seven years famine will follow them Then all abundance land Egypt will forgotten famine will devastate land abundance land will not remembered since famine follows will so severe Moreover because dream given Pharaoh two versions matter has been decreed by God He will carry out shortly Now therefore Pharaoh should look discerning wise man set him over land Egypt Let Pharaoh take action appoint commissioners over land take fifth harvest Egypt during seven years abundance Under authority Pharaoh let them collect all excess food from these good years they may come lay up grain preserved food cities This food will reserve land during seven years famine come upon land Egypt Then country will not perish famine This proposal pleased Pharaoh all his officials So Pharaoh asked them Can we find anyone like this man whom Spirit God abides Then Pharaoh said Joseph Since God has made all this known you there no one discerning wise you You shall charge my house all my people obey your commands Only regard throne will I greater than you Pharaoh also told Joseph I hereby place you over all land Egypt Then Pharaoh removed signet ring from his finger put on Joseph finger clothed him garments fine linen placed gold chain around his neck He had Joseph ride his second chariot men calling out before him Bow knee So he placed him over all land Egypt Pharaoh declared Joseph I am Pharaoh but without your permission no one all land Egypt shall lift his hand or foot Pharaoh gave Joseph name Zaphenath paneah he gave him Asenath daughter Potiphera priest On his wife Joseph took charge all land Egypt Now Joseph thirty years old when he entered service Pharaoh king Egypt Joseph left Pharaoh presence traveled throughout land Egypt During seven years abundance land brought forth bountifully During those seven years Joseph collected all excess food land Egypt stored cities every city he laid up food from fields around So Joseph stored up grain such abundance like sand sea he stopped keeping track beyond measure Before years famine arrived two sons born Joseph by Asenath daughter Potiphera priest On Joseph named firstborn Manasseh saying God has made me forget all my hardship all my father household second son he named Ephraim saying God has made me fruitful land my affliction When seven years abundance land Egypt came end seven years famine began just Joseph had said although there famine every country there food throughout land Egypt When extreme hunger came all land Egypt people cried out Pharaoh food he told all Egyptians Go Joseph do whatever he tells you When famine had spread over all land Joseph opened up all storehouses sold grain Egyptians famine severe land Egypt every nation came Joseph Egypt buy grain because famine severe over all earth When Jacob learned there grain Egypt he said his sons Why you staring one another Look he added I have heard there grain Egypt Go down there buy some us so we may live not die So ten Joseph brothers went down buy grain from Egypt But Jacob did not send Joseph brother Benjamin his brothers he said I am afraid harm might befall him So sons Israel among those who came buy grain since famine had also spread land Canaan Now Joseph ruler land he one who sold grain all its people So when his brothers arrived they bowed down before him their faces ground when Joseph saw his brothers he recognized them but he treated them strangers spoke harshly them Where have you come from he asked From land Canaan they replied We here buy food Although Joseph recognized his brothers they did not recognize him Joseph remembered his dreams about them said You spies You have come see if our land vulnerable Not so my lord they replied Your servants have come buy food We all sons one man Your servants honest men not spies No he told them You have come see if our land vulnerable But they answered Your servants twelve brothers sons one man land Canaan youngest now our father one no more Then Joseph declared Just I said you spies this how you will tested surely Pharaoh lives you shall not leave this place unless your youngest brother comes here Send one your number get your brother rest you will confined so truth your words may tested If they untrue then surely Pharaoh lives you spies So Joseph imprisoned them three days on third day he said them I fear God So do this you will live If you honest leave one your brothers custody while rest you go take back grain relieve hunger your households Then bring your youngest brother me so your words can verified you may not die this they consented Then they said one another Surely we being punished because our brother We saw his anguish when he pleaded us but we would not listen why this distress has come upon us Reuben responded Didnt I tell you not sin against boy But you would not listen Now we must account his blood They did not realize Joseph understood them since there interpreter between them he turned away from them wept When he turned back spoke them he took Simeon from them had him bound before their eyes Then Joseph gave orders fill their bags grain return each man silver his sack give them provisions their journey This order carried out they loaded grain on their donkeys departed place where they lodged night one them opened his sack get feed his donkey he saw his silver mouth sack My silver has been returned he said his brothers here my sack Their hearts sank trembling they turned one another said What this God has done us When they reached their father Jacob land Canaan they described him all

sons if I fail bring him back you Put him my care I will return him But Jacob replied My son will not go down there you his brother dead he alone left If any harm comes him on your journey you will bring my gray hair down Sheol sorrow Now famine still severe land So when Jacob sons had eaten all grain they had brought from Egypt their father said them Go back buy us little more food But Judah replied man solemnly warned us You will not see my face again unless your brother you If you will send our brother us we will go down buy food you But if you will not send him we will not go man told

me from there Balak took Balaam top Peor which overlooks wasteland Then Balaam said Build me seven altars here prepare me seven bulls seven rams So Balak did Balaam had instructed he offered bull ram on each altar when Balaam saw pleased LORD bless Israel he did not resort sorcery on previous occasions but he turned his face toward wilderness When Balaam looked up saw Israel encamped tribe by

together said Balaam I summoned you curse my enemies but behold you have persisted blessing them these three times Therefore flee once your home I said I would richly reward you but instead LORD has denied your reward Balaam answered Balak Did I not already tell messengers you sent me even if Balak give me his house full silver gold I could not do anything my own accord good or bad go beyond

come from coasts Cyprus they will subdue Asshur Eber but they too will perish forever Then Balaam arose returned his homeland Balak also went on his way While Israel staying Shittim men began indulge sexual immorality daughters Moab who also invited them sacrifices their gods people ate bowed down these gods So Israel joined worshiping Baal Peor anger LORD burned against them Then LORD said Moses Take all leaders people execute them broad daylight before LORD so His fierce anger may turn away from Israel So Moses told judges Israel Each you must kill all his men who have joined worshiping Baal

or obligates herself by pledge her father hears about her vow or pledge but says nothing her then all vows or pledges by which she has bound herself shall stand But if her father prohibits her on day he hears about then none vows or pledges by which she has bound herself shall stand LORD will absolve her because her father has prohibited her If woman marries while under vow or rash promise by

then nothing came from her lips whether her vows or pledges shall stand Her husband has nullified them LORD will absolve her Her husband may confirm or nullify any vow or any sworn pledge deny herself But if her husband says nothing her from day day then he confirms all vows pledges bind her He has confirmed them because he said nothing her on day he heard about them But if he nullifies them after he hears them then he will bear her iniquity These statutes LORD commanded Moses concerning relationship between man his wife between father young daughter still his home LORD said Moses Take

LORD has given them This what your fathers did when I sent them from Kadesh barnea inspect land when your fathers went up Valley Eshcol saw land they discouraged Israelites from entering land LORD had

whole generation who had done evil His sight gone Now behold you brood sinners have risen up place your fathers further stoke burning anger LORD against Israel if you turn away from following Him He

will arm ourselves ready go ahead Israelites until we have brought them into their place Meanwhile our little ones will remain fortified cities protection from inhabitants land We will not return our homes until every Israelite has taken possession his inheritance Yet we will not have inheritance them across Jordan beyond because our inheritance has come us on east side Jordan Moses replied If you will do this if you will arm yourselves before LORD battle if every one your armed men crosses Jordan before LORD until He has driven His enemies out before Him then when land subdued before LORD you may return free obligation LORD Israel this land will belong you possession before LORD But if you do not do this you will certainly sin against LORD assured your sin will find you out Build cities your little ones folds your flocks but do what you have promised Gadites Reubenites said Moses Your servants will do just our lord commands Our children our wives our livestock all our animals will

commanded apportion inheritance Israelites land Canaan Again LORD spoke Moses on plains Moab by Jordan across from Jericho Command Israelites give from inheritance they will possess cities Levites live pasturelands around cities cities will them live pasturelands will their herds their flocks all their other livestock pasturelands around cities you give Levites will extend thousand cubits from

cities Six cities you give Levites appointed cities refuge which manslayer may flee addition these give Levites forty two other cities total number cities you give Levites will forty eight their corresponding pasturelands cities you apportion from territory Israelites should given Levites proportion inheritance each tribe more from larger tribe less from smaller one Then LORD said Moses Speak Israelites tell them When you cross Jordan into land Canaan designate cities serve your cities refuge so person who kills someone unintentionally may flee there You have these cities refuge from avenger so manslayer will not die until he stands trial before assembly cities you select will your six cities refuge Select three cities across Jordan three land Canaan cities refuge These six cities

murderer murderer must surely put death avenger blood put murderer death when he finds him he kill him Likewise if anyone maliciously pushes another or intentionally throws object him kills him or if hostility he strikes him his hand he dies one who struck him must surely put death he murderer When avenger blood finds murderer he kill him But if anyone pushes person suddenly without hostility or

death high priest Only after death high priest may he return land he owns This will statutory ordinance you generations come wherever you live If anyone kills person murderer put death on testimony witnesses But no one put death based on testimony lone witness You not accept ransom life murderer who deserves die he must surely put death Nor should you accept ransom person who flees city refuge allow him return live on his own land before death high priest Do not pollute land where you live bloodshed pollutes land no atonement can made land on which blood shed except by blood one who shed Do not defile land where you live where I dwell I LORD dwell among Israelites Now family heads clan Gilead son Machir son Manasseh one clans Joseph approached Moses leaders who heads Israelite families addressed them saying When LORD commanded my lord give land inheritance Israelites by lot He also commanded him give inheritance our brother Zelophehad his daughters But if they marry any men from other tribes Israel their inheritance will withdrawn from portion our fathers added tribe into which they marry So our allotted inheritance would taken away when Jubilee Israelites comes their inheritance will added tribe into which they marry taken away from tribe our fathers So word LORD Moses commanded Israelites tribe sons Joseph speaks correctly This what LORD has commanded concerning daughters Zelophehad They may marry anyone they please provided they marry within clan tribe their father No inheritance Israel may transferred from tribe tribe because each Israelites retain inheritance tribe his fathers Every daughter who possesses inheritance from any Israelite tribe must marry within clan tribe her father so every Israelite will possess inheritance his fathers No inheritance may transferred from one tribe another each tribe Israel must retain its inheritance So daughters Zelophehad did LORD had commanded Moses Mahlah Tirzah Hoglah Milcah Noah daughters

entered your house they have come spy out whole land But woman had taken two men hidden them So she said Yes men did come me but I did not know where they had come from dusk when gate about close men went out I do not know which way they went Pursue them quickly you may catch them But Rahab had taken them up roof hidden them among stalks flax she had laid out there So king men set out pursuit spies along road fords Jordan soon they had gone out gate shut Before spies lay down night Rahab went up on roof said them I know LORD has given you this land fear you has fallen on us so all who dwell land melting fear you we have heard how LORD dried up waters Red Sea before you when you came out Egypt what you did Sihon Og two kings Amorites across Jordan whom you devoted destruction When

our hands they said Joshua Indeed all who dwell land melting fear us Early next morning Joshua got up left Shittim all Israelites They went far Jordan where they camped before crossing over After three days officers went through camp commanded people When you see ark covenant LORD your God being carried by Levitical priests you set out from your positions follow But keep distance about two thousand cubits between yourselves ark Do not go near so you can see way go since you have never traveled this way before Then Joshua told people Consecrate yourselves tomorrow LORD will do wonders among you he said priests Take ark covenant go on ahead people So they carried ark covenant went ahead them Now LORD said Joshua Today I will begin exalt you sight all Israel so they may know I am you just I Moses Command priests carrying ark covenant When you reach edge waters stand Jordan So Joshua told Israelites Come here listen words LORD your God He continued This how you will know living God among you He will surely drive out before you Canaanites Hittites Hivites Perizzites Girgashites Amorites Jebusites Behold ark covenant Lord all earth will go ahead you into Jordan Now choose twelve men from tribes Israel one from each tribe When feet priests who carry ark LORD Lord all earth touch down waters Jordan its flowing waters will cut off will stand up heap So when people broke camp cross Jordan priests carried ark covenant ahead them Now Jordan overflows its banks throughout harvest season But soon priests carrying ark reached Jordan their feet touched water edge flowing water stood still backed up far upstream Adam city area Zarethan while water flowing toward Sea Arabah Salt Sea completely cut off So people crossed over opposite Jericho priests carrying ark covenant LORD stood firm on dry ground middle Jordan while all Israel crossed over dry ground until entire nation had crossed Jordan When whole nation had finished crossing Jordan LORD said Joshua Choose twelve men from among people one from each tribe command them Take up yourselves twelve stones from middle Jordan where priests standing carry them you set them down place where you spend night So Joshua summoned twelve men he had appointed from Israelites one from each tribe said them Cross over before ark LORD your God into middle Jordan Each you take stone upon his shoulder according number tribes Israel serve sign among you future when your children ask What do these stones mean you you tell them waters Jordan cut off before ark covenant LORD When crossed Jordan waters cut off Therefore these stones will memorial Israelites forever Thus Israelites did Joshua had commanded them They took up twelve stones from middle Jordan one each tribe Israel just LORD had told Joshua they carried them camp where they set them down Joshua also set up twelve stones middle Jordan place where priests who carried ark covenant stood stones there this day Now priests who carried ark remained standing middle Jordan until people had completed everything LORD had commanded Joshua tell them just Moses had directed Joshua people hurried across after everyone had finished crossing priests ark LORD crossed sight people Reubenites Gadites half tribe Manasseh crossed over before Israelites armed battle Moses had instructed them About 40 000 troops armed battle crossed over before LORD into plains Jericho On day LORD exalted Joshua sight all Israel they revered him all days his life just they had revered Moses Then LORD said Joshua Command priests who carry ark Testimony come up from Jordan So Joshua commanded priests Come up from Jordan When priests carrying ark covenant LORD came up out Jordan their feet touched dry land waters Jordan returned their course overflowed all banks before On tenth day first month people went up from Jordan camped Gilgal on eastern border Jericho there Gilgal Joshua set up twelve stones they had taken from Jordan Then Joshua said Israelites future when your children ask their fathers What meaning these stones you tell them Israel crossed Jordan on dry ground LORD your God dried up waters Jordan before you until you had crossed over just He did Red Sea which He dried up before us until we had crossed over He did this so all peoples earth may know hand LORD mighty so you may always fear LORD your God Now when all Amorite kings west Jordan all Canaanite kings along coast heard how LORD had dried up waters Jordan before Israelites until they had crossed over their hearts melted their spirits failed fear Israelites time LORD said Joshua Make flint knives circumcise sons Israel once again So Joshua made flint knives circumcised sons Israel Gibeath haaraloth Now this why Joshua circumcised them All those who came out Egypt all men war had died on journey wilderness after they had left Egypt Though all who had come out circumcised none those born wilderness on journey from Egypt had been circumcised Israelites had wandered wilderness forty years until all nation men war who had come out Egypt had died since they did not obey LORD So LORD vowed never let them see land He had sworn their fathers give us land flowing milk honey Joshua raised up their sons their place these ones he circumcised Until this time they still uncircumcised since they had not been circumcised along way after all nation had been circumcised they stayed there camp until they healed Then LORD said Joshua Today I have rolled away reproach Egypt from you So place has been called Gilgal this day On evening fourteenth day month while Israelites camped Gilgal on plains Jericho they kept Passover day after Passover on very day they ate unleavened bread roasted grain from produce land day after they had eaten from produce land manna ceased There no more manna Israelites so year they began eat crops land Canaan Now when Joshua near Jericho he looked up saw man standing front him drawn sword His hand Joshua approached Him asked You us or our enemies Neither He replied I have now come Commander LORD army Then Joshua fell facedown reverence asked Him What does my Lord have say His servant Commander LORD army replied Take off your sandals place where you standing holy Joshua did so Now Jericho tightly shut up because Israelites No one went out no one came LORD said Joshua Behold I have delivered Jericho into your hand along its king its mighty men valor March around city all men war circling city one time Do this six days Have seven priests carry seven rams horns front ark Then on seventh day march around city seven times while priests blow horns when there long blast ram horn you hear its sound have all people give mighty shout Then wall city will collapse all your people will charge straight into city So Joshua son Nun summoned priests said Take up ark covenant have seven priests carry seven rams horns front ark LORD he told people Advance march around city armed troops going ahead ark LORD After Joshua had spoken people seven priests carrying seven rams horns before LORD advanced blew horns ark covenant LORD followed them While horns continued sound armed troops marched ahead priests who blew horns rear guard followed ark But Joshua had commanded people Do not give battle cry or let your voice heard do not let one word come out your mouth until day I tell you shout Then you shout So he had ark LORD carried around city circling once people returned camp spent night there Joshua got up early next morning priests took ark LORD seven priests carrying seven rams horns kept marching ahead ark LORD blowing horns armed troops went front them rear guard followed ark LORD while horns kept sounding So on second day they marched around city once returned camp They did this six days Then on seventh day they got up dawn marched around city seven times same manner only day they circled city seven times After seventh time around priests blew horns Joshua commanded people Shout LORD has given you city Now city everything must devoted LORD destruction Only Rahab prostitute all those her her house will live because she hid spies we sent But keep away from things devoted destruction lest you yourself set apart destruction If you take any these you will set apart camp Israel destruction bring disaster upon all silver gold all articles bronze iron holy LORD they must go into His treasury So when rams horns sounded people shouted When they heard blast horn people gave great shout wall collapsed Then all people charged straight into city captured edge sword they devoted destruction everything city man woman young old oxen sheep donkeys Meanwhile Joshua told two men who had spied out land Go into house prostitute bring out woman all who her just you promised her So young spies went brought out Rahab her father mother brothers all who belonged her They brought out her whole family settled them outside camp Israel Then Israelites burned up city everything However they put silver gold articles bronze iron into treasury LORD house Joshua spared Rahab prostitute her father household all who belonged her because she hid men Joshua had sent spy out Jericho So she has lived among Israelites this day time Joshua invoked this solemn oath Cursed before LORD man who rises up rebuilds this city Jericho cost his firstborn he will lay its foundations cost his youngest he will set up its gates So LORD Joshua his fame spread throughout land Israelites however acted unfaithfully regarding things devoted destruction Achan son Carmi son Zabdi son Zerah tribe Judah took some what set apart So anger LORD burned against Israelites Meanwhile Joshua sent men from Jericho Ai which near Beth aven east Bethel told them Go up spy out land So men went up spied out Ai On returning Joshua they reported There no need send all people two or three thousand men enough go up attack Ai Since people Ai so few you need not wear out all our people there So about three thousand men went up but they fled before men Ai men Ai struck down about thirty six them chasing them from gate far quarries striking them down on slopes So hearts people melted became like water Then Joshua tore his clothes fell facedown before ark LORD until evening did elders Israel they all sprinkled dust on their heads O Lord GOD Joshua said why did You ever bring this people across Jordan deliver us into hand Amorites destroyed If only we had been content stay on other side Jordan O Lord what can I say now Israel has turned its back run from its enemies When Canaanites all who live land hear about this they will surround us wipe out our name from earth Then what will You do Your great name But LORD said Joshua Stand up Why have you fallen on your face Israel has sinned they have transgressed My covenant I commanded them they have taken some what devoted destruction Indeed they have stolen lied they have put these things their own possessions This why Israelites cannot stand against their enemies They will turn their backs run from their enemies because they themselves have been set apart destruction I will no longer you unless you remove from among you whatever devoted destruction Get up consecrate people saying Consecrate yourselves tomorrow this what LORD God Israel says Among you O Israel there things devoted destruction You cannot stand against your enemies until you remove them morning you must present yourselves tribe by tribe tribe LORD selects shall come forward clan by clan clan LORD selects shall come forward family by family family LORD selects shall come forward man by man one who caught things devoted destruction must burned along all belongs him because he has transgressed covenant LORD committed outrage Israel So Joshua arose early next morning had Israel come forward tribe by tribe tribe Judah selected He had clans Judah come forward clan Zerahites selected He had clan Zerahites come forward family Zabdi selected he had family Zabdi come forward man by man Achan son Carmi son Zabdi son Zerah tribe Judah selected So Joshua said Achan My son give glory LORD God Israel make confession Him I urge you tell me what you have done do not hide from me

quickly perish from this good land He has given you Then Joshua assembled all tribes Israel Shechem He summoned elders leaders judges officers Israel they presented themselves before God Joshua said all people This what LORD God Israel says Long ago your fathers including Terah father Abraham Nahor lived beyond Euphrates worshiped other gods But I took your father Abraham from beyond Euphrates led him through all land Canaan I multiplied his descendants I gave him Isaac Isaac I gave Jacob Esau I gave Esau Mount Seir possess but Jacob his sons went down Egypt Then I sent Moses Aaron I afflicted Egyptians by what I did there afterward I brought you out When I brought your fathers out Egypt you reached Red Sea Egyptians pursued them chariots horsemen far Red Sea So your fathers cried out LORD He put darkness between you Egyptians over whom He brought sea engulfed them Your very eyes saw what I did Egyptians Then you lived wilderness long time Later I brought you land Amorites who

Perizzites into their hands they struck down ten thousand men Bezek there they found Adoni bezek fought against him striking down Canaanites Perizzites Adoni bezek fled they pursued him seized him cut off his thumbs big toes Then Adoni bezek said Seventy kings their thumbs big toes cut off have gathered scraps under my table I have done them so God has repaid me they brought him Jerusalem where he

Othniel urged him ask her father field When she got off her donkey Caleb asked her What do you desire Give me blessing she answered Since you have given me land Negev give me springs water well So

Joseph grew strength they pressed Amorites into forced labor border Amorites extended from Ascent Akrabbim Sela beyond Now angel LORD went up from Gilgal Bochim said I brought you up out Egypt led you into land I had promised your fathers I said I will never break My covenant you you not make covenant people this land but you shall tear down their altars Yet you have not obeyed My voice What this you have done So now I tell you I will not drive out these people before you they will thorns your sides their gods will snare you When angel LORD had spoken these words all Israelites people lifted up their voices wept So they called place Bochim offered sacrifices there LORD After Joshua had dismissed people Israelites went out take possession land each his own inheritance people served LORD throughout days Joshua elders who outlived him who had seen all great works LORD had done Israel Joshua son Nun servant LORD died age 110 They buried him land his inheritance Timnath heres hill country Ephraim north Mount Gaash After whole generation had also been gathered their fathers another generation rose up who did not know LORD or works He had done Israel Israelites did evil sight LORD served Baals Thus they forsook LORD God their fathers who had brought them out land Egypt they followed after various gods peoples around them They bowed down them provoked LORD anger they forsook Him served Baal Ashtoreths Then anger LORD burned against Israel He delivered them into hands those who plundered them He sold them into hands their enemies all around whom they no longer able resist Wherever Israel marched out hand LORD against them bring calamity just He had sworn them So they greatly distressed Then LORD raised up judges who saved them from hands those who plundered them Israel however did not listen their judges Instead they prostituted themselves other gods bowed down them They quickly turned from way their fathers who had walked obedience LORD commandments they did not do their fathers had done Whenever LORD raised up judge Israelites He judge saved them from hands their enemies while judge still alive LORD moved pity by their groaning under those who oppressed them afflicted them But when judge died Israelites became even more corrupt than their fathers going after other gods serve them bow down them They would not give up their evil practices stubborn ways So anger LORD burned against Israel He said Because this nation has transgressed covenant I laid down their fathers has not heeded My voice I will no longer drive out before them any nations Joshua left when he died this way I will test whether Israel will keep way LORD by walking their fathers did why LORD had left those nations place had not driven them out immediately by delivering them into

Philistines all Canaanites Sidonians Hivites who lived mountains Lebanon from Mount Baal hermon Lebo hamath These nations left test Israelites find out whether they would keep commandments LORD which He had given their fathers through Moses Thus Israelites continued live among Canaanites Hittites Amorites Perizzites Hivites Jebusites they took daughters these people marriage gave their own daughters their sons served their gods So Israelites did evil sight LORD they forgot LORD their God served Baals Asherahs Then anger LORD burned against Israel He sold them into hand Cushan rishathaim king Aram naharaim Israelites served him eight years But when Israelites cried out LORD He raised up Othniel son Caleb younger brother Kenaz deliverer save them Spirit LORD came upon him he became Israel judge went out war LORD delivered Cushan rishathaim king Aram into hand Othniel who prevailed against him So land had rest forty years until Othniel son Kenaz died Once again Israelites did

City Palms Israelites served Eglon king Moab eighteen years again they cried out LORD He raised up Ehud son Gera left handed Benjamite their deliverer So they sent him tribute Eglon king Moab Now Ehud

Philistines Thus they forsook LORD did not serve Him So anger LORD burned against Israel He sold them into hands Philistines Ammonites who very year harassed oppressed Israelites did so eighteen years all Israelites on other side Jordan Gilead land Amorites Ammonites also crossed Jordan fight against Judah Benjamin house Ephraim Israel deep distress Then Israelites cried out LORD saying We have sinned against You we have indeed forsaken our God served Baals LORD replied When Egyptians Amorites Ammonites Philistines Sidonians Amalekites Maonites oppressed you you cried out Me did I not save you from their hands But you have forsaken Me served other gods so I will no longer save you Go cry out gods you have chosen Let them save you your time trouble We have sinned Israelites said LORD Deal us You see fit but please deliver us today So they put away foreign gods from among them served LORD He could no longer bear misery Israel Then Ammonites called arms camped Gilead Israelites assembled camped Mizpah rulers Gilead said one another Whoever will launch attack against Ammonites will head all who live Gilead Now Jephthah Gileadite mighty man valor he son prostitute Gilead his father Gilead wife bore him sons who grew up drove Jephthah out said him You shall have no inheritance our father house because you son another woman So Jephthah fled from his brothers settled land Tob where worthless men gathered around him traveled him Some time later when Ammonites fought against Israel made war them elders Gilead went get Jephthah from land Tob Come they said our commander so we can fight against Ammonites Jephthah replied elders Gilead Did you not hate me expel me from my father house Why then have you come me now when you distress They answered Jephthah This why we now turn you you may go us fight Ammonites become leader over all us who live Gilead But Jephthah asked them If you take me back fight Ammonites LORD gives them me will I really your leader elders Gilead said Jephthah LORD our witness if we do not do you say So Jephthah went elders Gilead people made him their leader commander Jephthah repeated all his terms presence LORD Mizpah Then Jephthah sent messengers king Ammonites saying What do you have against me you have come fight against my land king Ammonites answered Jephthah messengers When Israel came up out Egypt they seized my land from Arnon Jabbok all way Jordan Now therefore restore peaceably Jephthah again sent messengers king Ammonites tell him This what Jephthah says Israel did not take away land Moab or Ammonites But when Israel came up out Egypt they traveled through wilderness Red Sea came Kadesh Then Israel sent messengers king Edom saying Please let us pass through your land but king Edom would not listen They also sent messengers king Moab but he would not consent So Israel stayed Kadesh Then Israel traveled through wilderness bypassed lands Edom Moab They came east side land Moab camped on other side Arnon But they did not enter territory Moab since Arnon its border Israel sent messengers Sihon king Amorites who ruled Heshbon said him Please let us pass through your land into our own place But Sihon would not trust Israel pass through his territory So he gathered all his people encamped Jahaz fought Israel Then LORD God Israel delivered Sihon all his people into hand Israel who defeated them So Israel took possession all land Amorites who inhabited country seizing all land from Arnon Jabbok from wilderness Jordan Now since LORD God Israel has driven out Amorites from before His people Israel should you now possess Do you not possess whatever your god Chemosh grants you So also we possess whatever LORD our God has granted us you now so much better than Balak son Zippor king Moab Did he ever contend Israel or fight against them three hundred years Israel has lived Heshbon Aroer their villages well all cities along banks Arnon Why did you not take them back during time I have not sinned against you but you have done me wrong by waging war against me May LORD Judge decide today between Israelites Ammonites But king Ammonites paid no heed message Jephthah sent him Then Spirit LORD came upon Jephthah he passed through Gilead Manasseh then through Mizpah Gilead from there he advanced against Ammonites Jephthah made this vow LORD If indeed You will deliver Ammonites into my hand then whatever comes out door my house greet me on my triumphant return from Ammonites will belong LORD I will offer up burnt offering So Jephthah crossed over Ammonites fight against them LORD delivered them into his hand great blow he devastated twenty cities from Aroer vicinity Minnith far Abel keramim So Ammonites subdued before Israelites when Jephthah returned home Mizpah there his daughter coming out meet him tambourines dancing She his only child he had no son or daughter besides her soon Jephthah saw her he tore his clothes said No Not my daughter You have brought me my knees You have brought great misery upon me I have given my word LORD cannot take back My father she replied you have given your word LORD Do me you have said LORD has avenged you your enemies Ammonites She also said her father Let me do this one thing Let me wander two months through mountains my friends mourn my virginity Go he said he sent her away two months So she left her friends mourned her virginity upon mountains After two months she returned her father he did her he had vowed she had never had relations man So has become custom Israel each year young women Israel go out four days lament daughter Jephthah Gileadite Then men Ephraim assembled crossed Jordan Zaphon They said Jephthah Why have you crossed over fight Ammonites without calling us go you We will burn your house down you inside But Jephthah replied My people I had serious conflict Ammonites when I called you did not save me out their hands When I saw you would not save me I risked my life crossed over Ammonites LORD delivered them into my hand Why then have you come today fight against me Jephthah then gathered all men Gilead fought against Ephraim men Gilead struck them down because Ephraimites had said You Gileadites fugitives Ephraim living territories Ephraim Manasseh Gileadites captured fords Jordan leading Ephraim whenever fugitive from Ephraim would say Let me cross over Gileadites would ask him

LORD their God He sold them into hand Sisera commander army Hazor into hands Philistines king Moab who fought against them Then they cried out LORD said We have sinned we have forsaken LORD served Baals Ashtoreths Now deliver us from hands our enemies we may serve You So LORD sent Jerubbaal Barak Jephthah Samuel He delivered you from hands your enemies on every side you dwelt securely But when

furious filled indignation He ridiculed Jews before his associates army Samaria saying What these feeble Jews doing Can they restore wall by themselves Will they offer sacrifices Will they complete day Can they bring these burnt stones back life from mounds rubble Then Tobiah Ammonite who beside him said If even fox climb up on what they building would break down their wall stones Hear us O God we despised Turn their scorn back upon their own heads let them taken plunder land captivity Do not cover up their iniquity or let their sin blotted out from Your sight they have provoked builders So we rebuilt wall until all joined together up half its height people had mind work When Sanballat Tobiah together Arabs Ammonites Ashdodites heard repair walls Jerusalem progressing gaps being closed they furious all them conspired come fight against Jerusalem create hindrance So we prayed our God posted guard against them day night Meanwhile people Judah said strength laborer fails there so much rubble we will never able rebuild wall our enemies said Before they know or see thing we will come into their midst kill them put end work time Jews who lived nearby came told us ten times over Wherever you turn they will attack us So I stationed men behind lowest sections wall vulnerable areas I stationed them by families their swords spears bows After I had made inspection I stood up said nobles officials rest people Do not afraid them Remember Lord who great awesome fight your brothers your sons your daughters your wives your homes When our enemies heard we aware their scheme God had frustrated each us returned his own work on wall from day on half my servants did work while other half held spears shields bows armor officers stationed themselves behind all people Judah who rebuilding wall laborers who carried materials worked one hand held weapon other each builders worked his sword strapped his side But trumpeter stayed beside me Then I said nobles officials rest people work great extensive we spread out far from one another along wall Wherever you hear sound horn rally us there Our God will fight us So we continued work while half men held spears from break dawn until stars came out time I also said people Let every man his servant spend night inside Jerusalem so they can stand guard by night work by day So neither I nor my brothers nor my servants nor guards me changed out our clothes each carried his weapon even go water About time there great outcry from people their wives against their fellow Jews Some saying We our sons daughters numerous We must get grain order eat stay alive Others saying We mortgaging our fields our vineyards our homes get grain during famine Still others saying We have borrowed money pay king tax on our fields vineyards We our children just like our countrymen their children yet we subjecting our sons daughters slavery Some our daughters already enslaved but we powerless redeem them because our fields vineyards belong others When I heard their outcry these complaints I became extremely angry after serious thought I rebuked nobles officials saying You exacting usury from your own brothers So I called large assembly against them said We have done our best buy back our Jewish brothers who sold foreigners but now you selling your own brothers they may sold back us But they remained silent they could find nothing say So I continued What you doing not right Shouldnt you walk fear our God avoid reproach our foreign enemies I well my brothers my servants have been lending people money grain

Furthermore from day King Artaxerxes appointed me their governor land Judah from his twentieth year until his thirty second year twelve years total neither I nor my brothers ate food allotted governor governors before me had heavily burdened people taking from them bread wine plus forty shekels silver Their servants also oppressed people but I did not do this because my fear God Instead I devoted myself construction wall all my servants gathered there work we did not acquire any land There 150 Jews officials my table besides guests from surrounding nations Each day one ox six choice sheep some

King Xerxes preeminent among Jews highly favored by his many kinsmen seeking good his people speaking peace all his countrymen There man land Uz whose name Job this man blameless upright fearing God shunning evil He had seven sons three daughters he owned 7 000 sheep 3 000 camels 500 yoke oxen 500 female donkeys very large number servants Job greatest man all people East Job sons would take turns holding feasts their homes they would invite their three sisters eat drink them when days feasting over Job would send his children purify them rising early morning offer burnt offerings all them Job thought Perhaps my children have sinned cursed God their hearts This Job regular practice One day sons God came present themselves before LORD Satan also came them Where have you come from said LORD Satan From roaming through earth he replied walking back forth Then LORD said Satan Have you considered My servant Job there no one on earth like him man who blameless upright who fears God shuns evil Satan answered LORD Does Job fear God nothing Have You not placed hedge on every side around him his household all he owns You have blessed work his hands his possessions have increased land But stretch out Your hand strike all he has he will surely curse You Your face Very well said LORD Satan Everything he has your hands but you must not lay hand on man himself Then Satan went out from presence LORD One day while Job sons daughters eating drinking wine their oldest brother house messenger came reported Job While oxen plowing donkeys grazing nearby Sabeans swooped down took them away They put servants sword I alone have escaped tell you While he still speaking another messenger came reported fire God fell from heaven burned consumed sheep servants I alone have escaped tell you While he still speaking another messenger came reported Chaldeans formed three bands raided camels took them away They put servants sword I alone have escaped tell you While he still speaking another messenger came reported Your sons daughters eating drinking wine their oldest brother house when suddenly mighty wind swept from desert struck four corners house collapsed on young people they dead I alone have escaped tell you Then Job stood up tore his robe shaved his head He fell ground worshiped saying Naked I came from my mother womb naked I will return LORD gave LORD has taken away Blessed name LORD all this Job did not sin or charge God wrongdoing On another day sons God came present themselves before LORD Satan also came them present himself before Him Where have you come from said LORD Satan From roaming through earth he replied walking back forth Then LORD said Satan Have you considered My servant Job there no one on earth like him man who blameless upright who fears God shuns evil He still retains his integrity even though you incited Me against him ruin him without cause Skin skin Satan replied man will give up all he owns exchange his life But stretch out Your hand strike his flesh bones he will surely curse You Your face Very well said LORD Satan He your hands but you must spare his life So Satan went out from presence LORD infected Job terrible boils from soles his feet crown his head Job took piece broken pottery scrape himself he sat among ashes Then Job wife said him Do you still retain your integrity Curse God die You speak foolish woman speaks he told her Should we accept from God only good not adversity all this Job did not sin what he said Now when Job three friends Eliphaz Temanite Bildad Shuhite Zophar Naamathite heard about all this adversity had come upon him each them came from his home they met together go sympathize Job comfort him When they lifted up their eyes from afar they could barely recognize Job They began weep aloud each man tore his robe threw dust air over his head Then they sat on ground him seven days seven nights but no one spoke word him because they saw how intense his suffering After this Job opened his mouth cursed day his birth this what he said May day my birth perish night said boy conceived If only day had turned darkness May God above disregard may no light shine upon May darkness gloom reclaim cloud settle over may blackness day overwhelm If only darkness had taken night away May not appear among days year may never entered any months Behold may night barren may no joyful voice come into May cursed by those who curse day those prepared rouse Leviathan May its morning stars grow dark may wait vain daylight may not see breaking dawn night did not shut doors womb hide sorrow from my eyes Why did I not perish birth why did I not die I came from womb Why there knees receive me breasts I should nursed now I would lying down peace I would asleep rest kings counselors earth who built themselves cities now ruins or princes who had gold who filled their houses silver Or why I not hidden like stillborn child like infant who never sees daylight There wicked cease from raging there weary find rest captives enjoy their ease they do not hear voice oppressor Both small great there slave freed from his master Why light given miserable life bitter soul who long death does not come search like hidden treasure who rejoice greatly exult when they can find grave Why life given man whose way hidden whom God has hedged I sigh when food put before me my groans pour out like water thing I feared has overtaken me what I dreaded has befallen me I am not ease or quiet I have no rest trouble has come Then Eliphaz Temanite replied If one ventures word you will you wearied Yet who can keep from speaking Surely you have instructed many have strengthened their feeble hands Your words have steadied those who stumbled you have braced knees buckling But now trouble has come upon you you weary strikes you you dismayed your reverence not your confidence uprightness your ways your hope Consider now I plead Who being innocent has ever perished Or where have upright been destroyed I have observed those who plow iniquity those who sow trouble reap same By breath God they perish by blast His anger they consumed lion may roar fierce lion may growl yet teeth young lions broken old lion perishes lack prey cubs lioness scattered Now word came me secretly my ears caught whisper disquieting visions night when deep sleep falls on men fear trembling came over me made all my bones shudder Then spirit glided past my face hair on my body bristled stood still but I could not discern its appearance form loomed before my eyes I heard whispering voice Can mortal more righteous than God or man more pure than his Maker If God puts no trust His servants He charges His angels error how much more those who dwell houses clay whose foundations dust who can crushed like moth They smashed pieces from dawn dusk unnoticed they perish forever not their tent cords pulled up so they die without wisdom Call out if you please but who will answer which holy ones will you turn resentment kills fool envy slays simple I have seen fool taking root but suddenly his house cursed His sons far from safety crushed court without defender hungry consume his harvest taking even from thorns thirsty pant after his wealth distress does not spring from dust trouble does not sprout from ground Yet man born trouble surely sparks fly upward However if I you I would appeal God lay my cause before Him One who does great unsearchable things wonders without number He gives rain earth sends water upon fields He sets lowly on high so mourners lifted safety He thwarts schemes crafty so their hands find no success He catches wise their craftiness sweeps away plans cunning They encounter darkness by day grope noon night He saves needy from sword their mouth from clutches powerful So poor have hope injustice shuts its mouth Blessed indeed man whom God corrects so do not despise discipline Almighty He wounds but He also binds He strikes but His hands also heal He will rescue you from six calamities no harm will touch you seven famine He will redeem you from death battle from stroke sword You will hidden from scourge tongue will not fear havoc when comes You will laugh destruction famine need not fear beasts earth you will have covenant stones field wild animals will peace you You will know your tent secure find nothing amiss when inspecting your home You will know your offspring will many your descendants like grass earth You will come grave full vigor like sheaf grain gathered season Indeed we have investigated true So hear know yourself Then Job replied If only my grief could weighed placed my calamity on scales then would outweigh sand seas no wonder my words have been rash arrows Almighty have pierced me my spirit drinks their poison terrors God arrayed against me Does wild donkey bray over fresh grass or ox low over its fodder tasteless food eaten without salt or there flavor white egg My soul refuses touch them they loathsome food me If only my request granted God would fulfill my hope God would willing crush me unleash His hand cut me off still brings me comfort joy through unrelenting pain I have not denied words Holy One What strength do I have I should still hope What my future I should patient my strength like stone or my flesh made bronze there any help within me now success driven from me despairing man should have kindness his friend even if he forsakes fear Almighty But my brothers faithless wadis seasonal streams overflow darkened because ice inflow melting snow but ceasing dry season vanishing from their channels heat Caravans turn aside from their routes they go into wasteland perish caravans Tema look water travelers Sheba hope find They confounded because they had hoped their arrival brings disappointment now you no help you see terror you afraid Have I ever said Give me something offer me bribe from your wealth deliver me from hand enemy redeem me from grasp ruthless Teach me I will silent Help me understand how I have erred How painful honest words But what does your argument prove Do you intend correct my words treat wind my cry despair You would even cast lots orphan barter away your friend But now please look me Would I lie your face Reconsider do not unjust Reconsider my righteousness stake there iniquity on my tongue Can my mouth not discern malice not man consigned labor on earth not his days like those hired hand Like slave he longs shade like hireling he waits his wages So I am allotted months futility nights misery appointed me When I lie down I think When will I get up But night drags on I toss turn until dawn My flesh clothed worms encrusted dirt my skin cracked festering My days swifter than weaver shuttle they come end without hope Remember my life but breath My eyes will never again see happiness eye beholds me will no longer see me You will look me but I will no more cloud vanishes gone so he who goes down Sheol does not come back up He never returns his house his place remembers him no more Therefore I will not restrain my mouth I will speak anguish my spirit I will complain bitterness my soul Am I sea or monster deep You must keep me under guard When I think my bed will comfort me my couch will ease my complaint then You frighten me dreams terrify me visions so I would prefer strangling death over my life this body I loathe my life I would not live forever Leave me alone my days but breath What man You should exalt him You should set Your heart upon him You attend him every morning test him every moment Will You never look away from me or leave me alone swallow my spittle If I have sinned what have I done You O watcher mankind Why have You made me Your target so I am burden You Why do You not pardon my transgression take away my iniquity soon I will lie down dust You will seek me but I will no more Then Bildad Shuhite replied How long will you go on saying such things words your mouth blustering wind Does God pervert justice Does Almighty pervert what right When your children sinned against Him He gave them over their rebellion But if you would earnestly seek God ask Almighty mercy if you pure upright even now He will rouse Himself on your behalf restore your righteous estate Though your beginnings modest your latter days will flourish Please inquire past generations consider discoveries their fathers we born yesterday know nothing our days on earth but shadow Will they not teach you tell you speak from their understanding Does papyrus grow where there no marsh Do reeds flourish without water While shoots still uncut they dry up quicker than grass Such destiny all who forget God so hope godless will perish His confidence fragile his security spider web He leans on his web but gives way he holds fast but does not endure He well watered plant sunshine spreading its shoots over garden His roots wrap around rock heap he looks home among stones If he uprooted from his place will disown him saying I never saw you Surely this joy his way yet others will spring from dust Behold God does not reject blameless nor will He strengthen hand evildoers He will yet fill your mouth laughter your lips shout joy Your enemies will clothed shame tent wicked will no more Then Job answered Yes I know so but how can mortal righteous before God If one wished contend God he could not answer Him one time out thousand God wise heart mighty strength Who has resisted Him prospered He moves mountains without their knowledge overturns them His anger He shakes earth from its place so its foundations tremble He commands sun not shine He seals off stars He alone stretches out heavens treads on waves sea He Maker Bear Orion Pleiades constellations south He does great things beyond searching out wonders without number He pass by me I would not see Him He move I would not recognize Him If He takes away who can stop Him Who dares ask Him What You doing God does not restrain His anger helpers Rahab cower beneath Him How then can I answer Him or choose my arguments against Him even if I right I could not answer I could only beg my Judge mercy If I summoned Him He answered me I do not believe He would listen my voice He would crush me tempest multiply my wounds without cause He does not let me catch my breath but overwhelms me bitterness If matter strength He indeed mighty If matter justice who can summon Him Even if I righteous my mouth would condemn me if I blameless would declare me guilty Though I am blameless I have no concern myself I despise my own life all same so I say He destroys both blameless wicked When scourge brings sudden death He mocks despair innocent earth given into hand wicked He blindfolds its judges If not He then who My days swifter than runner they flee without seeing good They sweep by like boats papyrus like eagle swooping down on its prey If I say I will forget my complaint change my expression smile I would still dread all my sufferings I know You will not acquit me Since I am already found guilty why should I labor vain If I should wash myself snow cleanse my hands lye then You would plunge me into pit even my own clothes would despise me He not man like me I can answer Him we can take each other court Nor there mediator between us lay his hand upon us both Let Him remove His rod from me so His terror will no longer frighten me Then I would speak without fear Him But I am on my own I loathe my own life I will express my complaint speak bitterness my soul I will say God Do not condemn me Let me know why You prosecute me Does please You oppress me reject work Your hands favor schemes wicked Do You have eyes flesh Do You see man sees Your days like those mortal or Your years like those man You should seek my iniquity search out my sin though You know I am not guilty there no deliverance from Your hand Your hands shaped me altogether formed me Would You now turn destroy me Please remember You molded me like clay Would You now return me dust Did You not pour me out like milk curdle me like cheese You clothed me skin flesh knit me together bones sinews You have granted me life loving devotion Your care has preserved my spirit Yet You concealed these things Your heart I know this Your mind If I sinned You would take note would not acquit me my iniquity If I am guilty woe me even if I am righteous I cannot lift my head I am full shame aware my affliction Should I hold my head high You would hunt me like lion again display Your power against me You produce new witnesses against me multiply Your anger toward me Hardships assault me wave after wave Why then did You bring me from womb Oh I had died no eye had seen me If only I had never come but had been carried from womb grave my days not few Withdraw from me I may have little comfort before I go never returnto land darkness gloom land utter darkness deep shadow disorder where even light like darkness Then Zophar Naamathite replied Should this stream words go unanswered such speaker vindicated Should your babbling put others silence Will you scoff without rebuke You have said My doctrine sound I am pure Your sight But if only God would speak open His lips against you disclose you secrets wisdom true wisdom has two sides Know then God exacts from you less than your iniquity deserves Can you fathom deep things God or discover limits Almighty They higher

not know such things these I am laughingstock my friends though I called on God He answered righteous upright man laughingstock one ease scorns misfortune fate those whose feet slipping tents robbers safe those who provoke God secure those who carry their god their hands But ask animals they will instruct you ask birds air they will tell you Or speak earth will teach you let fish sea inform you

smear lies you all worthless physicians If only you would remain silent would your wisdom Hear now my argument listen plea my lips Will you speak wickedly on God behalf or speak deceitfully Him Would

endure Do You open Your eyes one like this Will You bring him into judgment before You Who can bring out clean from unclean No one Since his days determined number his months You since You have set limits he cannot exceed look away from him let him rest so he can enjoy his day hired hand there hope tree If cut down will sprout again its tender shoots will not fail If its roots grow old ground its stump dies soil scent water will bud put forth twigs like sapling But man dies laid low he breathes his last where he water disappears from sea river becomes parched dry so man lies down does not rise Until heavens no more he will not awakened or roused from sleep If only You would hide me Sheol conceal me until Your anger has passed If only You would appoint time me then remember me When man dies will he live again All days my hard service I will wait until my renewal comes You will call I will answer You will desire work Your hands then You would count my steps but would not keep track my sin My transgression would sealed bag You would cover over my iniquity But mountain erodes crumbles rock dislodged from its place water wears away stones torrents wash away soil so You destroy man hope You forever overpower him he passes on You change his countenance send him away If his sons receive honor he does not know if they brought low he unaware He feels only pain his own body mourns only himself Then Eliphaz Temanite replied Does wise man answer empty counsel or fill his belly hot east wind Should he argue useless words or speeches serve no purpose But you even undermine fear God hinder meditation before Him your iniquity instructs your mouth you choose language crafty Your own mouth not mine condemns you your own lips testify against you you first man ever born you brought forth before hills Do you listen on council God or limit wisdom yourself What do you know we do not What do you understand not clear us Both gray haired aged on our side men much older than your father consolations God not enough you even words spoken gently you Why has your heart carried you away why do your eyes flash you turn your spirit against God pour such words from your mouth What man he should pure or one born woman he should righteous If God puts no trust His holy ones if even heavens not pure His eyes how much less man who vile corrupt who drinks injustice like water Listen me I will inform you I will describe what I have seen what declared by wise men not concealed from their fathers whom alone land given when no foreigner passed among them wicked man writhes pain all his days only few years reserved ruthless Sounds terror fill his ears his prosperity destroyer attacks him He despairs his return from darkness he marked sword He wanders about food vultures he knows day darkness hand Distress anguish terrify him overwhelming him like king poised attack he has stretched out his hand against God has vaunted himself against Almighty rushing headlong Him thick studded shield Though his face covered fat his waistline bulges flesh he will dwell ruined cities abandoned houses destined become rubble He will no longer rich his wealth will not endure His possessions will not overspread land He will not escape from darkness flame will wither his shoots breath God mouth will carry him away Let him not deceive himself trust emptiness emptiness will his reward will paid full before his time his branch will not flourish He will like vine stripped its unripe grapes like olive tree sheds its blossoms company godless will barren fire will consume tents bribery They conceive trouble give birth evil their womb pregnant deceit Then Job answered I have heard many things like these miserable comforters you all there no end your long winded speeches What provokes you continue testifying I could also speak like you if you my place I could heap up words against you shake my head you But I would encourage you my mouth consolation my lips would bring relief Even if I speak my pain not relieved if I hold back how will go away Surely He has now exhausted me You have devastated all my family You have bound me has become witness my frailty rises up testifies against me His anger has torn me opposed me He gnashes His teeth me My adversary pierces me His eyes They open their mouths against me strike my cheeks contempt they join together against me God has delivered me unjust men He has thrown me clutches wicked I ease but He shattered me He seized me by neck crushed me He has set me up His target His archers surround me He pierces my kidneys without mercy spills my gall on ground He breaks me wound upon wound He rushes me like mighty warrior I have sewn sackcloth over my skin I have buried my horn dust My face red weeping deep shadows ring my eyes yet my hands free violence my prayer pure O earth do not cover my blood may my cry help never laid rest Even now my witness heaven my advocate on high My friends my scoffers my eyes pour out tears God Oh man might plead God he pleads his neighbor when only few years past I will go way no return My spirit broken my days extinguished grave awaits me Surely mockers surround me my eyes must gaze their rebellion Give me I pray pledge You demand Who else will my guarantor You have closed their minds understanding therefore You will not exalt them If man denounces his friends price eyes his children will fail He has made me byword among people man whose face they spit My eyes have grown dim grief my whole body but shadow upright appalled this innocent stirred against godless Yet righteous one holds his way one clean hands grows stronger But come back try again all you I will not find wise man among you My days have passed my plans broken off even desires my heart They have turned night into day making light seem near face darkness If I look Sheol my home if I spread out my bed darkness say corruption You my father worm My mother or My sister where then my hope Who can see any hope me Will go down gates Sheol Will we go down together into dust Then Bildad Shuhite replied How long until you end these speeches Show some sense then we can talk Why we regarded cattle stupid your sight You who tear yourself anger should earth forsaken on your account or rocks moved from their place Indeed lamp wicked extinguished flame his fire does not glow light his tent grows dark lamp beside him goes out His vigorous stride shortened his own schemes trip him up his own feet lead him into net he wanders into its mesh trap seizes his heel snare grips him noose hidden ground trap lies his path Terrors frighten him on every side harass his every step His strength depleted calamity ready his side devours patches his skin firstborn death devours his limbs He torn from shelter his tent marched off king terrors Fire resides his tent burning sulfur rains down on his dwelling roots beneath him dry up branches above him wither away memory him perishes from earth he has no name land He driven from light into darkness chased from inhabited world He has no offspring or posterity among his people no survivor where he once lived Those west appalled his fate while those east tremble horror Surely such dwelling wicked place one who does not know God Then Job answered How long will you torment me crush me your words Ten times now you have reproached me you shamelessly mistreat me Even if I have truly gone astray my error concerns me alone If indeed you would exalt yourselves above me use my disgrace against me then understand God who has wronged me drawn His net around me Though I cry out Violence I get no response though I call help there no justice He has blocked my way so I cannot pass He has veiled my paths darkness He has stripped me my honor removed crown from my head He tears me down on every side until I am gone He uproots my hope like tree His anger burns against me He counts me among His enemies His troops advance together they construct ramp against me encamp around my tent He has removed my brothers from me my acquaintances have abandoned me My kinsmen have failed me my friends have forgotten me My guests maidservants count me stranger I am foreigner their sight I call my servant but he does not answer though I implore him my own mouth My breath repulsive my wife I am loathsome my own family Even little boys scorn me when I appear they deride me All my best friends despise me those I love have turned against me My skin flesh cling my bones I have escaped by skin my teeth Have pity on me my friends have pity hand God has struck me Why do you persecute me God does Will you never get enough my flesh I wish my words recorded inscribed book by iron stylus on lead or chiseled stone forever But I know my Redeemer lives end He will stand upon earth Even after my skin has been destroyed yet my flesh I will see God I will see Him myself my eyes will behold Him not stranger How my heart yearns within me If you say Let us persecute him since root matter lies him then you should fear sword yourselves because wrath brings punishment by sword so you may know there judgment Then Zophar Naamathite replied So my anxious thoughts compel me answer because turmoil within me I have heard rebuke insults me my understanding prompts reply Do you not know from antiquity since man placed on earth triumph wicked has been brief joy godless momentary Though his arrogance reaches heavens his head touches clouds he will perish forever like his own dung those who had seen him will ask Where he He will fly away like dream never found he will chased away like vision night eye saw him will see him no more his place will no longer behold him His sons will seek favor poor his own hands must return his wealth youthful vigor fills his bones will lie down him dust Though evil sweet his mouth he conceals under his tongue though he cannot bear let go keeps his mouth yet his stomach his food sours into venom cobras within him He swallows wealth but vomits out God will force from his stomach He will suck poison cobras fangs viper will kill him He will not enjoy streams rivers flowing honey cream He must return fruit his labor without consuming he cannot enjoy profits his trading he has oppressed forsaken poor he has seized houses he did not build Because his appetite never satisfied he cannot escape his treasure Nothing left him consume thus his prosperity will not endure midst his plenty he will distressed full force misery will come upon him When he has filled his stomach God will vent His fury upon him raining down on him he eats Though he flees from iron weapon bronze tipped arrow will pierce him drawn out his back gleaming point from his liver Terrors come over him Total darkness reserved his treasures fire unfanned will consume him devour what left his tent heavens will expose his iniquity earth will rise up against him possessions his house will removed flowing away on day God wrath This wicked man portion from God inheritance God has appointed him Then Job answered Listen carefully my words let this your consolation me Bear me while I speak then after I have spoken you may go on mocking my complaint against man Then why should I not impatient Look me appalled put your hand over your mouth When I remember terror takes hold my body trembles horror Why do wicked live on growing old increasing power Their descendants established around them their offspring before their eyes Their homes safe from fear no rod punishment from God upon them Their bulls breed without fail their cows bear calves do not miscarry They send forth their little ones like flock their children skip about singing tambourine lyre making merry sound flute They spend their days prosperity go down Sheol peace Yet they say God Leave us alone we have no desire know Your ways Who Almighty we should serve Him what would we gain if we pray Him Still their prosperity not their own hands so I stay far from counsel wicked How often lamp wicked put out Does disaster come upon them Does God His anger apportion destruction they like straw before wind like chaff swept away by storm said God lays up one punishment his children Let God repay man himself so he will know Let his eyes see his own destruction let him drink himself wrath Almighty what does he care about his household after him when number his months has run out Can anyone teach knowledge God since He judges those on high One man dies full vigor completely secure ease His body well nourished his bones rich marrow Yet another man dies bitterness his soul having never tasted prosperity But together they lie down dust worms cover them both Behold I know your thoughts full well schemes by which you would wrong me you say Where now nobleman house where tents which wicked dwell Have you never asked those who travel roads Do you not accept their reports Indeed evil man spared from day calamity delivered from day wrath Who denounces his behavior his face Who repays him what he has done He carried grave watch kept over his tomb clods valley sweet him everyone follows behind him those before him without number So how can you comfort me empty words your answers remain full falsehood Then Eliphaz Temanite replied Can man use God Can even wise man benefit Him Does delight Almighty you righteous Does He profit if your ways blameless your reverence He rebukes you enters into judgment against you not your wickedness great not your iniquities endless you needlessly demanded security from your brothers deprived naked their clothing You gave no water weary withheld food from famished while land belonged mighty man man honor lived on You sent widows away empty handed strength fatherless crushed Therefore snares surround you sudden peril terrifies you so dark you cannot see flood water covers you not God high heavens Look highest stars how lofty they Yet you say What does God know Does He judge through thick darkness Thick clouds veil Him so He does not see us He traverses vault heaven Will you stay on ancient path wicked men have trod They snatched away before their time their foundations swept away by flood They said God Depart from us What can Almighty do us But He who filled their houses good things so I stay far from counsel wicked righteous see glad innocent mock them Surely our foes destroyed fire has consumed their excess Reconcile now peace Him thereby good will come you Receive instruction from His mouth lay up His words your heart If you return Almighty you will restored If you remove injustice from your tents consign your gold dust gold Ophir stones ravines then Almighty will your gold finest silver you Surely then you will delight Almighty lift up your face God You will pray Him He will hear you you will fulfill your vows Your decisions will carried out light will shine on your ways When men brought low you say Lift them up then He will save lowly He will deliver even one who not innocent rescuing him through cleanness your hands Then Job answered Even today my complaint bitter His hand heavy despite my groaning If only I knew where find Him so I could go His seat I would plead my case before Him fill my mouth arguments I would learn how He would answer consider what He would say Would He contend me His great power No He would certainly take note me Then upright man could reason Him I would delivered forever from my Judge If I go east He not there if I go west I cannot find Him When He work north I cannot behold Him when He turns south I cannot see Him Yet He knows way I have taken when He has tested me I will come forth gold My feet have followed His tracks I have kept His way without turning aside I have not departed from command His lips I have treasured words His mouth more than my daily bread But He unchangeable who can oppose Him He does what He desires He carries out His decree against me He has many such plans Therefore I am terrified His presence when I consider this I fear Him God has made my heart faint Almighty has terrified me Yet I am not silenced by darkness by thick darkness covers my face Why does Almighty not reserve times judgment Why may those who know Him never see His days Men move boundary stones they pasture stolen flocks They drive away donkey fatherless take widow ox pledge They push needy off road force all poor land into hiding Indeed like wild donkeys desert poor go work foraging food wasteland food their children They gather fodder fields glean vineyards wicked Without clothing they spend night naked they have no covering against cold Drenched by mountain rains they huddle against rocks want shelter fatherless infant snatched from breast nursing child poor seized debt Without clothing they wander about naked They carry sheaves but still go hungry They crush olives within their walls they tread winepresses but go thirsty From city men groan souls wounded cry out yet God charges no one wrongdoing Then there those who rebel against light not knowing its ways or staying on its paths When daylight gone murderer rises kill poor needy night he like thief eye adulterer watches twilight Thinking No eye will see me he covers his face dark they dig through houses by day they shut themselves never experience light them deep darkness their morning surely they friends terrors darkness They but foam on surface water their portion land cursed so no one turns toward their vineyards drought heat consume melting snow so Sheol steals those who have sinned womb forgets them worm feeds on them they remembered no more So injustice like broken tree They prey on barren childless show no kindness widow Yet by His power God drags away mighty though rising up they have no assurance life He gives them sense security but His eyes on their ways They exalted moment then they gone they brought low gathered up like all others they cut off like heads grain If this not so then who can prove me liar reduce my words nothing Then Bildad Shuhite replied Dominion awe belong God He establishes harmony heights heaven Can His troops numbered On whom does His light not rise How then can man just before God How can one born woman pure If even moon does not shine stars not pure His sight how much less man who but maggot son man who but worm Then Job answered How you have helped powerless saved arm feeble How you have counseled unwise provided fully sound insight whom have you uttered these words whose spirit spoke through you dead tremble those beneath waters those who dwell them Sheol naked before God Abaddon has no covering He stretches out north over empty space He hangs earth upon nothing He wraps up waters His clouds yet clouds do not burst under their own weight He covers face full moon spreading over His cloud He has inscribed horizon on face waters boundary between light darkness foundations heaven quake astounded His rebuke By His power He stirred sea by His understanding He shattered Rahab By His breath skies cleared His hand pierced fleeing serpent Indeed these but fringes His ways how faint whisper we hear Him Who then can understand thunder His power Job continued his discourse surely God lives who has deprived me justice Almighty who has embittered my soul long my breath still within me breath God remains my nostrils my lips will not speak wickedness my tongue will not utter deceit I will never say you right I will maintain my integrity until I die I will cling my righteousness never let go long I live my conscience will not accuse me May my enemy like wicked my opponent like unjust what hope godless when he cut off when God takes away his life Will God hear his cry when distress comes upon him Will he delight Almighty Will he call upon God all times I will instruct you power God I will not conceal ways Almighty Surely all you have seen yourselves Why then do you keep up this empty talk This wicked man portion from God heritage ruthless receive from Almighty Though his sons many they destined sword his offspring will never have enough food His survivors will buried by plague their widows will not weep them Though he heaps up silver like dust piles up wardrobe like clay what he lays up righteous will wear his silver will divided by innocent house he built like moth cocoon like hut set up by watchman He lies down wealthy but will do so no more when he opens his eyes all gone Terrors overtake him like flood tempest sweeps him away night east wind carries him away he gone sweeps him out his place hurls itself against him without mercy he flees headlong from its power claps its hands him hisses him out his place Surely there mine silver place where gold refined Iron taken from earth copper smelted from ore Man puts end darkness he probes farthest recesses ore deepest darkness Far from human habitation he cuts shaft places forgotten by foot man Far from men he dangles sways Food may come from earth but from below transformed by fire Its rocks source sapphires containing flecks gold No bird prey knows path no falcon eye has seen Proud beasts have never trodden no lion has ever prowled over miner strikes flint he overturns mountains their base He hews out channels rocks his eyes spot every treasure He stops up sources streams bring what hidden light But where can wisdom found where does understanding dwell No man can know its value nor found land living ocean depths say not me while sea declares not me cannot bought gold nor can its price weighed out silver cannot valued gold Ophir precious onyx or sapphire Neither gold nor crystal can compare nor jewels fine gold exchanged Coral quartz unworthy mention price wisdom beyond rubies Topaz from Cush cannot compare nor can valued pure gold From where then does wisdom come where does understanding dwell hidden from eyes every living thing concealed from birds air Abaddon Death say We have heard rumor about But God understands its way He knows its place He looks ends earth sees everything under heavens When God fixed weight wind measured out waters when He set limit rain path thunderbolt then He looked wisdom appraised He established searched out He said man Behold fear Lord wisdom turn away from evil understanding Job continued his discourse How I long months gone by days when God watched over me when His lamp shone above my head by His light I walked through darkness when I my prime when friendship God rested on my tent when Almighty still me my children around me when my steps bathed cream rock poured out me streams oil When I went out city gate took my seat public square young men saw me withdrew old men rose their feet princes refrained from speaking covered their mouths their hands voices nobles hushed their tongues stuck roofs their mouths those who heard me called me blessed those who saw me commended me because I rescued poor who cried out fatherless who had no helper dying man blessed me I made widow heart sing joy I put on righteousness clothed me justice my robe my turban I served eyes blind feet lame I father needy I took up case stranger I shattered fangs unjust snatched prey from his teeth So I thought I will die my nest multiply my days sand My roots will spread out waters dew will rest nightly on my branches My glory ever new within me my bow renewed my hand Men listened me expectation waiting silently my counsel After my words they spoke no more my speech settled on them like dew They waited me rain drank my words like spring showers If I smiled them they did not believe light my countenance precious I chose their course presided chief So I dwelt king among his troops comforter mourners But now they mock me men younger than I am whose fathers I would have refused entrust my sheep dogs What use me strength their hands since their vigor had left them Gaunt from poverty hunger they gnawed dry land desolate wasteland by night They plucked mallow among shrubs roots broom tree their food They banished from among men shouted down like thieves so they lived on slopes wadis among rocks holes ground They cried out among shrubs huddled beneath nettles senseless nameless brood they driven off land now they mock me song I have become byword among them They abhor me keep far from me they do not hesitate spit my face Because God has unstrung my bow afflicted me they have cast off restraint my presence rabble arises my right they lay snares my feet build siege ramps against me They tear up my path they profit from my destruction no one restrain them They advance through wide breach through ruins they keep rolling Terrors turned loose against me they drive away my dignity by wind my prosperity has passed like cloud now my soul poured out within me days affliction grip me Night pierces my bones my gnawing pains never rest great force He grasps my garment He seizes me by collar my tunic He throws me into mud I have become like dust ashes I cry out You help but You do not answer when I stand up You merely look me You have ruthlessly turned on me You oppose me Your strong hand You snatch me up into wind drive me before You toss me about storm Yes I know You will bring me down death place appointed all living Yet no one stretches out his hand ruined man when he cries help his distress Have I not wept those trouble Has my soul not grieved needy But when I hoped good evil came when I looked light darkness fell I am churning within cannot rest days affliction confront me I go about blackened but not by sun I stand up assembly cry help I have become brother jackals companion ostriches My skin grows black peels my bones burn fever My harp tuned mourning my flute sound weeping I have made covenant my eyes How then could I gaze desire virgin what allotment God from above or heritage from Almighty on high Does not disaster come unjust calamity workers iniquity Does He not see my ways count my every step If I have walked falsehood or my foot has rushed deceit let God weigh me honest scales He may know my integrity If my steps have turned from path if my heart has followed my eyes or if impurity has stuck my hands then may another eat what I have sown may my crops uprooted If my heart has been enticed by my neighbor wife or I have lurked his door then may my own wife grind grain another may other men sleep her would heinous crime iniquity judged fire burns down Abaddon would root out my entire harvest If I have rejected cause my manservant or maidservant when they made complaint against me what will I do when God rises judge How will I answer when called account Did not He who made me womb also make them Did not same One form us womb If I have denied desires poor or allowed widow eyes fail if I have eaten my morsel alone not sharing fatherless though from my youth I reared him would father from my mother womb I guided widow if I have seen one perish lack clothing or needy man without cloak if his heart has not blessed me warming him fleece my sheep if I have lifted up my hand against fatherless because I saw I had support gate then may my arm fall from my shoulder torn from its socket calamity from God terrifies me His splendor I cannot overpower If I have put my trust gold or called pure gold my security if I have rejoiced my great wealth because my hand had gained so much if I have beheld sun its radiance or moon moving splendor so my heart secretly enticed my hand threw kiss from my mouth this would also iniquity judged I would have denied God on high If I have rejoiced my enemy ruin or exulted when evil befell him I have not allowed my mouth sin by asking his life curse if men my house have not said Who there who has not had his fill but no stranger had lodge on street my door has been open traveler if I have covered my transgressions like Adam by hiding my guilt my heart because I greatly feared crowds contempt clans terrified me so I kept silent would not go outside Oh I had one hear me Here my signature Let Almighty answer me let my accuser compose indictment Surely I would carry on my shoulder wear like crown I would give account all my steps I would approach Him like prince if my land cries out against me its furrows weep together if I have devoured its produce without payment or broken spirit its tenants then let briers grow instead wheat stinkweed instead barley Thus conclude words Job So these three men stopped answering Job because he righteous his own eyes This kindled anger Elihu son Barachel Buzite family Ram He burned anger against Job justifying himself rather than God he burned anger against Job three friends because they had failed refute Job yet had condemned him Now Elihu had waited speak Job because others older than he But when he saw three men had no further reply his anger kindled So Elihu son Barachel Buzite declared I am young years while you old why I timid afraid tell you what I know I thought age should speak many years should teach wisdom But there spirit man breath Almighty gives him understanding not only old who wise or elderly who understand justice Therefore I say Listen me I too will declare what I know Indeed I waited while you spoke I listened your reasoning you searched words I paid you full attention But no one proved Job wrong not one you rebutted his arguments So do not claim We have found wisdom let God not man refute him But Job has not directed his words against me I will not answer him your arguments Job friends dismayed no more say words have escaped them Must I wait now they silent now they stand no longer reply I too will answer yes I will declare what I know I am full words my spirit within me compels me Behold my belly like unvented wine about burst like new wineskin I must speak find relief I must open my lips respond I will partial no one nor will I flatter any man I do not know how flatter or my Maker would remove me instant But now O Job hear my speech listen all my words Behold I will open my mouth my address on tip my tongue My words from upright heart my lips speak sincerely what I know Spirit God has made me breath Almighty gives me life Refute me if you can prepare your case confront me I am just like you before God I also formed from clay Surely no fear me should terrify you nor will my hand heavy upon you Surely you have spoken my hearing I have heard these very words I am pure without transgression I am clean no iniquity me Yet God finds occasions against me He counts me His enemy He puts my feet stocks He watches over all my paths Behold you not right this matter I will answer you God greater than man Why do you complain Him He answers nothing man asks God speaks one way another yet no one notices dream vision night when deep sleep falls upon men they slumber on their beds He opens their ears terrifies them warnings turn man from wrongdoing keep him from pride preserve his soul from Pit his life from perishing by sword man also chastened on his bed pain constant distress his bones so he detests his bread his soul loathes his favorite food His flesh wastes away from sight his hidden bones protrude He draws near Pit his life messengers death Yet if there messenger on his side one mediator thousand tell man what right him gracious him say Spare him from going down Pit I have found his ransom then his flesh refreshed like child he returns days his youth He prays God finds favor he sees God face shouts joy God restores His righteousness man Then he sings before men these words I have sinned perverted what right yet I did not get what I deserved He redeemed my soul from going down Pit I will live see light Behold all these things God does man two or even three times bring back his soul from Pit he may enlightened light life Pay attention Job listen me silent I will speak But if you have something say answer me speak up I would like vindicate you But if not then listen me quiet I will teach you wisdom Then Elihu continued Hear my words O wise men give ear me O men learning ear tests words mouth tastes food Let us choose ourselves what right let us learn together what good Job has declared I am righteous yet God has deprived me justice Would I lie about my case My wound incurable though I am without transgression What man like Job who drinks up derision like water He keeps company evildoers walks wicked men he has said profits man nothing he should delight God Therefore listen me O men understanding Far from God do wrong from Almighty act unjustly according man deeds He repays him according man ways He brings consequences Indeed true God does not act wickedly Almighty does not pervert justice Who gave Him charge over earth Who appointed Him over whole world If He set His heart withdraw His Spirit breath all flesh would perish together mankind would return dust If you have understanding hear this listen my words Could one who hates justice govern Will you condemn just mighty One who says kings You worthless nobles You wicked who not partial princes does not favor rich over poor they all work His hands They die instant middle night people convulse pass away mighty removed without human hand His eyes on ways man He sees his every step There no darkness or deep shadow where workers iniquity can hide God need not examine man further or have him approach judgment He shatters mighty without inquiry sets up others their place Therefore He recognizes their deeds He overthrows them night they crushed He strikes them their wickedness full view because they turned aside from Him had no regard any His ways They caused cry poor come before Him He heard outcry afflicted But when He remains silent who can condemn Him When He hides His face who can see Him Yet He watches over both man nation godless men should not rule or lay snares people Suppose someone says God I have endured my punishment I will offend no more Teach me what I cannot see if I have done wrong I will not do again Should God repay you on your own terms when you have disavowed His You must choose not I so tell me what you know Men understanding will declare me wise men who hear me will say Job speaks without knowledge his words lack insight If only Job tried utmost answering like wicked man he adds rebellion his sin he claps his hands among us multiplies his words against God Elihu went on say Do you think this just You say I am more righteous than God you ask What does profit me what benefit do I gain apart from sin I will reply you your friends well Look heavens see gaze clouds high above you If you sin what do you accomplish against Him If you multiply your transgressions what do you do Him If you righteous what do you give Him or what does He receive from your hand Your wickedness affects only man like yourself your righteousness only son man Men cry out under great oppression they plead relief from arm mighty But no one asks Where God my Maker who gives us songs night who teaches us more than beasts earth makes us wiser than birds air There they cry out but He does not answer because pride evil men Surely God does not listen empty pleas Almighty does not take note How much less then when you say you do not see Him your case before Him you must wait Him further His anger He has not punished or taken much notice folly So Job opens his mouth vain multiplies words without knowledge Elihu continued Bear me little longer I will show you there more said on God behalf I get my knowledge from afar I will ascribe justice my Maker truly my words free falsehood one perfect knowledge you Indeed God mighty but He despises no one He mighty strength understanding He does not keep wicked alive but He grants justice afflicted He does not take His eyes off righteous but He enthrones them kings exalts them forever if men bound chains caught cords affliction then He tells them their deeds how arrogantly they have transgressed He opens their ears correction commands they turn from iniquity If they obey serve Him then they end their days prosperity their years happiness But if they do not obey then they perish by sword die without knowledge godless heart harbor resentment even

rises sun sets hurries back where rises wind blows southward then turns northward round round swirls ever returning on its course All rivers flow into sea yet sea never full place from which streams come there again they flow All things wearisome more than one can describe eye not satisfied seeing nor ear content hearing What has been will again what has been done will done again there nothing new under sun there case where one can say Look this new has already existed ages before us There no remembrance those who came before those yet come will not remembered by those who follow after I Teacher king over Israel Jerusalem I set my mind seek explore by wisdom all done under heaven What heavy burden God has laid upon sons men occupy them I have seen all things done under sun have found them all futile pursuit wind What crooked cannot straightened what lacking cannot counted I said myself Behold I have grown increased wisdom beyond all those before me who over Jerusalem my mind has observed wealth wisdom knowledge So I set my mind know wisdom madness folly I learned this too pursuit wind much wisdom comes much sorrow knowledge grows grief increases I said myself Come now I will test you pleasure enjoy what good But proved futile I said laughter folly pleasure What does accomplish I sought cheer my body wine embrace folly my mind still guiding me wisdom until I could see what worthwhile men do under heaven during few days their lives I expanded my pursuits I built houses planted vineyards myself I made gardens parks myself where I planted all kinds fruit trees I built reservoirs water my groves flourishing trees I acquired menservants maidservants servants born my house I also owned more herds flocks than anyone Jerusalem before me I accumulated myself silver gold treasure kings provinces I gathered myself male female singers delights sons men many concubines So I became great surpassed all Jerusalem who had preceded me my wisdom remained me Anything my eyes desired I did not deny myself I refused my heart no pleasure my heart took delight all my work this reward all my labor Yet when I considered all works my hands had accomplished what I had toiled achieve I found everything futile pursuit wind there nothing gained under sun Then I turned consider wisdom madness folly what more can king successor do than what has already been accomplished I saw wisdom exceeds folly just light exceeds darkness wise man has eyes his head but fool walks darkness Yet I also came realize one fate overcomes them both So I said myself fate fool will also befall me What then have I gained by being wise I said myself this too futile there no lasting remembrance wise just fool seeing both will forgotten days come Alas wise man will die just like fool So I hated life because work done under sun grievous me everything futile pursuit wind I hated all which I had toiled under sun because I must leave man who comes after me who knows whether man will wise or foolish Yet he will take over all labor which I have worked skillfully under sun This too futile So my heart began despair over all labor I had done under sun When there man who has labored wisdom knowledge skill he must give his portion man who has not worked this too futile great evil what does man get all toil striving which he labors under sun Indeed all his days filled grief his task sorrowful even night his mind does not rest This too futile Nothing better man than eat drink enjoy his work I have also seen this from hand God apart from Him who can eat who can find enjoyment man who pleasing His sight He gives wisdom knowledge joy but sinner He assigns task gathering accumulating which he will hand over one who pleases God This too futile pursuit wind everything there season

stones together time embrace time refrain from embracing time search time count lost time keep time discard time tear time mend time silent time speak time love time hate time war time peace What does worker gain from his toil I have seen burden God has laid upon sons men occupy them He has made everything beautiful its time He has also set eternity hearts men yet they cannot fathom work God has done from beginning end I know there nothing better them than rejoice do good while they live also every man should eat drink find satisfaction all his labor this gift God I know everything God does endures forever nothing can added or taken from God does so they should fear Him What exists has already been what will has already been God will call account what has passed Furthermore I saw under sun place judgment there wickedness place righteousness there wickedness I said my heart God will judge righteous wicked since there time every activity every deed I said myself sons men God tests them so they may see themselves they but beasts fates both men beasts same one dies so dies other they all have same breath Man has no advantage over animals since everything futile All go one place all come from dust all return dust Who knows if spirit man rises upward spirit animal descends into earth I have seen there nothing better man than enjoy his work because his lot who can bring him see what will come after him Again I looked I considered all oppression taking place under sun I saw tears oppressed they had no comforter power lay hands their oppressors there no comforter So I admired dead who had already died above living who still alive But better than both he who has not yet existed who has not seen evil done under sun I saw all labor success spring from man envy his neighbor This too futile pursuit wind fool folds his hands consumes his own flesh Better one handful tranquility than two handfuls toil pursuit wind Again I saw futility under sun There man all alone without even son or brother though there no end his labor his eyes still not content his wealth whom do I toil bereave my soul enjoyment This too futile miserable task Two better than one because they have good return their labor if one falls down his companion can lift him up but pity one who falls without another help him up Again if two lie down together they will keep warm but how can one keep warm alone though one may overpowered two can resist Moreover cord three strands not quickly broken Better poor but wise youth than old but foolish king who no longer knows how take warning youth has come from prison kingship though he born poor his own kingdom I saw all who lived walked under sun followed this second one youth who succeeded king There no limit all people who before them Yet successor

this his lot Furthermore God has given riches wealth every man He has enabled him enjoy them accept his lot rejoice his labor This gift from God man seldom considers days his life because God keeps him occupied joy his heart There another evil I have seen under sun weighs heavily upon mankind God gives man riches wealth honor so he lacks nothing his heart desires but God does not allow him enjoy them Instead stranger will enjoy them This futile grievous affliction man may father hundred children live many years yet no matter how long he lives if he unsatisfied his prosperity does not even receive proper burial I say stillborn child better off than he stillborn child enters futility departs darkness his name shrouded obscurity child though neither seeing sun nor knowing anything has more rest than man even if he lives thousand years twice over but fails enjoy his prosperity Do not all go same place All man labor his mouth yet his appetite never satisfied What advantage then has wise man over fool What gain comes poor man who knows how conduct himself before others Better what eye can see than wandering desire This too futile pursuit wind Whatever exists named long ago what happens man foreknown but he cannot contend one stronger than he more words more futility how does profit anyone who knows what good man during few days which he passes through his fleeting life like shadow Who can tell man what will come after him under sun good name better than fine perfume one day death better than his day birth better enter house mourning than house feasting since death end every man living should take this heart Sorrow better than laughter sad countenance good heart heart wise house mourning but heart fools house pleasure better heed wise man rebuke than listen song fools like crackling thorns under pot so laughter fool This too futile Surely extortion turns wise man into fool bribe corrupts heart end matter better than beginning patient spirit better than proud one Do not quickly provoked your spirit anger settles lap fool Do not say Why old days better than these unwise you ask about this Wisdom like inheritance good benefits those who see sun wisdom like money shelter advantage knowledge wisdom preserves life its owner Consider work God Who can straighten what He has bent day prosperity joyful but day adversity consider this God has made one these along other so man cannot discover anything will come after him my futile life I have seen both these righteous man perishing his righteousness wicked man living long his wickedness Do not overly righteous do not make yourself too wise Why should you destroy yourself Do not excessively wicked do not fool Why should you die before your time good grasp one not let other slip from your hand he who fears God will follow both warnings Wisdom makes wise man stronger than ten rulers city Surely there no righteous man on earth who does good never sins Do not pay attention every word spoken or you may hear your servant cursing you you know your heart many times you yourself have cursed others All this I tested by wisdom saying I resolve wise But beyond me What exists out reach very deep Who can fathom I directed my mind understand explore search out wisdom explanations understand stupidity wickedness folly madness I find more bitter than death woman who snare whose heart net whose hands chains man who pleases God escapes her but sinner ensnared Behold says Teacher I have discovered this by adding one thing another find explanation While my soul still searching but not finding among thousand I have found one upright man but among all these I have not found one such woman Only this have I found I have discovered God made men upright but they have sought out many schemes Who like wise man Who knows interpretation matter man wisdom brightens his face sternness his face changed Keep king command I say because your oath before God Do not hasten leave his presence do not persist bad cause he will do whatever he pleases king word supreme who can say him What you doing Whoever keeps his command will come no harm wise heart knows right time procedure there right time procedure every purpose though man misery weighs heavily upon him Since no one knows what will happen who can tell him what come no man has power over wind contain so no one has authority over his day death no one can discharged wartime so wickedness will not release those who practice All this I have seen applying my mind every deed done under sun there time when one man lords over another his own detriment Then too I saw burial wicked who used go out holy place they praised city where they had done so This too futile When sentence crime not speedily executed hearts men become fully set on doing evil Although sinner does evil hundred times still lives long yet I also know will go well those who fear God who reverent His presence Yet because wicked do not fear God will not go well them their days will not lengthen like shadow There futility done on earth There righteous men who get what actions wicked deserve there wicked men who get what actions righteous deserve I say this too futile So I commended enjoyment life because there nothing better man under sun than eat drink merry this joy will accompany him his labor during days his life God gives him under sun When I applied my mind know wisdom observe task one performs on earth though his eyes do not see sleep day or even night I saw every work God man unable comprehend work done under sun Despite his efforts search out he cannot find its meaning even if wise man claims know he unable comprehend So I took all this heart concluded righteous wise well their deeds God hands Man does not know what lies ahead whether love or hate same all There common fate righteous wicked good bad clean unclean one who sacrifices one who does not good so sinner one who makes vow so one who refuses take vow This evil everything done under sun There one fate everyone Furthermore hearts men full evil madness while they alive afterward they join dead There hope however anyone who among living even live dog better than dead lion living know they will die but dead know nothing They have no further reward because memory them forgotten Their love their hate their envy have already vanished they will never again have share all done under sun Go eat your bread joy drink your wine cheerful heart God has already approved your works Let your garments always white never spare oil your head Enjoy life your beloved wife all days fleeting life God has given you under sun all your fleeting days this your portion life your labor under sun Whatever you find do your hands do all your might Sheol where you going there no work or planning or knowledge or wisdom I saw something else under sun race not swift nor battle strong neither bread wise nor wealth intelligent nor favor skillful time chance happen all surely no man knows his time Like fish caught cruel net or birds trapped snare so men ensnared evil time suddenly falls upon them I have also seen this wisdom under sun great me There small city few men mighty king came against surrounded built large siege ramps against Now poor wise man found city he saved city by his wisdom Yet no one remembered poor man I said Wisdom better than strength but wisdom poor man despised his words not heeded calm words wise heeded over shouts ruler among fools Wisdom better than weapons war but one sinner destroys much good dead flies bring stench perfumer oil so little folly outweighs wisdom honor wise man heart inclines right but heart fool left Even fool walks along road his sense lacking he shows everyone he fool If ruler temper flares against you do not abandon your post calmness lays great offenses rest There evil I have seen under sun error proceeds from ruler Folly appointed great heights but rich sit lowly positions I have seen slaves on horseback while princes go on foot like slaves He who digs pit may fall into he who breaches wall may bitten by snake one who quarries stones may injured by them he who splits logs endangers himself If axe dull blade unsharpened more strength must exerted but skill produces success If snake bites before charmed there no profit charmer words wise man mouth gracious but lips fool consume him beginning his talk folly end his speech evil madness Yet fool multiplies words No one knows what coming who can tell him what will come after him toil fool wearies him he does not know way city Woe you O land whose king youth whose princes feast morning Blessed you O land whose king son nobles whose princes feast proper time strength not drunkenness Through laziness roof caves hands idle house leaks feast prepared laughter wine makes life merry but money answer everything Do not curse king even your thoughts or curse rich even your bedroom bird air may carry your words winged creature may report your speech Cast your bread upon waters after many days you will find again Divide your portion among seven or even eight you do not know what disaster may befall land If clouds full they will pour out rain upon earth whether tree falls south or north place where falls there will lie He who watches wind will fail sow he who observes clouds will fail reap you do not know path wind or how bones formed mother womb so you cannot understand work God Maker all things Sow your seed morning do not rest your hands evening you do not know which will succeed whether this or or if both will equally prosper Light sweet pleases eyes see sun So if man lives many years let him rejoice them all But let him remember days darkness they will many Everything come futile Rejoice O young man while you young let your heart glad days your youth Walk ways your heart sight your eyes but know all these things God will bring you judgment So banish sorrow from your heart cast off pain from your body youth vigor fleeting Remember your Creator days your youth before days adversity come years approach which you will say I find no pleasure them before light sun moon stars darkened clouds return after rain on day keepers house tremble strong men stoop when those grinding cease because they few those watching through windows see dimly when doors street shut sound mill fades away when one rises sound bird all daughters song grow faint when men fear heights dangers road when almond tree blossoms grasshopper loses its spring caper berry shrivels then man goes his eternal home mourners walk streets Remember Him before silver cord snapped golden bowl crushed before pitcher shattered spring wheel broken well before dust returns ground from which came spirit returns God who gave Futility futilities says Teacher Everything futile Not only Teacher wise but he also taught people knowledge he pondered searched out arranged many proverbs Teacher searched find delightful sayings record accurate words truth words wise like goads anthologies masters like firmly embedded nails driven by single Shepherd by these my son further warned There no end making many books much study wearies body When all has been heard conclusion matter this Fear God keep His commandments because this whole duty man God will bring every deed into judgment along every hidden thing whether good or evil This Solomon Song Songs Let him

between Me My vineyard What more could I have done My vineyard than I already did Why when I expected sweet grapes did bring forth sour fruit Now I will tell you what I am about do My vineyard I will take away its hedge will consumed I will tear down its wall will trampled I will make wasteland neither pruned nor cultivated thorns briers will grow up I will command clouds rain shall not fall on vineyard LORD Hosts house Israel men Judah plant His delight He looked justice but saw bloodshed righteousness but heard cry distress Woe you who add house house join field field until no place left you live alone land I heard LORD Hosts declare Surely many houses will become desolate great mansions left unoccupied ten acres vineyard will yield but bath wine homer seed only ephah grain Woe those who rise early morning pursuit strong drink who linger into evening inflamed by wine their feasts lyre harp tambourines flutes wine They disregard actions LORD fail see work His hands Therefore My people will go into exile their lack understanding their dignitaries starving their masses parched thirst Therefore Sheol enlarges its throat opens wide its enormous jaws down go Zion nobles masses her revelers carousers So mankind will brought low each man humbled arrogant will lower their eyes But LORD Hosts will exalted by His justice holy God will show Himself holy righteousness Lambs will graze their own pastures strangers will feed ruins wealthy Woe those who draw iniquity cords deceit pull sin along cart ropes those who say Let Him hurry hasten His work so we may see Let plan Holy One Israel come so we may know Woe those who call evil good good evil who turn darkness light light darkness who replace bitter sweet sweet bitter Woe those who wise their own eyes clever their own sight Woe those who heroes drinking wine champions mixing strong drink who acquit guilty bribe deprive innocent justice Therefore tongue fire consumes straw dry grass shrivels flame so their roots will decay their blossoms will blow away like dust they have rejected instruction LORD Hosts despised word Holy One Israel Therefore anger LORD burns against His people His hand raised against them strike them down mountains quake corpses lay like refuse streets Despite all this His anger not turned away His hand still upraised He lifts banner distant nations whistles those ends earth Behold how speedily swiftly they come None them grows weary or stumbles no one slumbers or sleeps No belt loose no sandal strap broken Their arrows sharpened all their bows strung hooves their horses like flint their chariot wheels like whirlwind Their roaring like lion they roar like young lions They growl seize their prey they carry away from deliverance day they will roar over like roaring sea If one looks over land he will see darkness distress even light will obscured by clouds year King Uzziah died I saw Lord seated on throne high exalted train His robe filled temple Above Him stood seraphim each having six wings two wings they covered their faces two they covered their feet two they flying they calling out one another Holy holy holy LORD Hosts all earth full His glory sound their voices doorposts thresholds shook temple filled smoke Then I said Woe me I am ruined because I am man unclean lips dwelling among people unclean lips my eyes have seen King LORD Hosts Then one seraphim flew me his hand glowing coal he had taken tongs from altar he touched my mouth said Now this has touched your lips your iniquity removed your sin atoned Then I heard voice Lord saying Whom shall I send Who will go Us I said Here am I Send me He replied Go tell this people ever hearing but never understanding ever seeing but never perceiving Make hearts this people calloused deafen their ears close their eyes Otherwise they might see their eyes hear their ears understand their hearts turn healed Then I asked How long O Lord He replied Until cities lie ruined without inhabitant until houses left unoccupied land desolate ravaged until LORD has driven men far away land utterly forsaken though tenth remains land will burned again terebinth oak leave stumps when felled so holy seed will stump land Now days Ahaz son Jotham son Uzziah king Judah Rezin king Aram marched up wage war against Jerusalem He accompanied by Pekah son Remaliah king Israel but he could not overpower city When reported house David Aram league Ephraim hearts Ahaz his people trembled like trees forest shaken by wind Then LORD said Isaiah Go out your son Shear jashub meet Ahaz end aqueduct feeds upper pool on road Launderer Field say him Calm down quiet Do not afraid or disheartened over these two smoldering stubs firewood over fierce anger Rezin Aram son Remaliah Aram along Ephraim son Remaliah has plotted

Damascus Rezin Within sixty five years Ephraim will shattered people head Ephraim Samaria head Samaria son Remaliah If you do not stand firm your faith then you will not stand all Again LORD spoke Ahaz saying Ask sign from LORD your God whether from depths Sheol or heights heaven But Ahaz replied I will not ask I will not test LORD Then Isaiah said Hear now O house David not enough try patience men Will you try patience my God well Therefore Lord Himself will give you sign Behold virgin will child will give birth son will call Him Immanuel By time He knows enough reject evil choose good He will eating curds honey before boy knows enough reject evil choose good land two kings you dread will laid waste LORD will bring on you on your people on house your father time unlike any since day Ephraim separated from Judah He will bring king Assyria On day LORD will whistle flies farthest streams Nile bees land Assyria they will all come settle steep ravines clefts rocks all thornbushes

Maher shalal hash baz before boy knows how cry Father or Mother wealth Damascus plunder Samaria will carried off by king Assyria LORD spoke me further Because this people has rejected gently flowing waters Shiloah rejoiced Rezin son Remaliah Lord will surely bring against them mighty floodwaters Euphrates king Assyria all his pomp will overflow its channels overrun its banks will pour into Judah swirling sweeping over reaching up neck its spreading streams will cover your entire land O Immanuel Huddle together O peoples shattered pay attention all you distant lands prepare battle shattered prepare battle shattered Devise plan but will thwarted state proposal but will not happen God us this what LORD has spoken me strong hand instructing me not walk way this people Do not call conspiracy everything these people regard conspiracy Do not fear what they fear do not live dread LORD Hosts One you shall regard holy Only He should feared only He should dreaded He will sanctuary but both houses Israel stone stumbling rock offense dwellers Jerusalem trap snare Many will stumble over these they will fall broken they will ensnared captured Bind up testimony seal law among my disciples I will wait LORD who hiding His face from house Jacob I will put my trust Him Here am I children LORD has given me signs symbols Israel from LORD Hosts who dwells on Mount Zion When men tell you consult spirits dead spiritists who whisper mutter shouldnt people consult their God instead Why consult dead on behalf living law testimony If they do not speak according this word they have no light dawn They will roam land dejected hungry When they famished they will become enraged looking upward they will curse their king their God Then they will look earth see only distress darkness gloom anguish they will driven into utter darkness Nevertheless there will no more gloom those distress past He humbled land Zebulun land Naphtali but future He will honor Way Sea beyond Jordan Galilee nations people walking darkness have seen great light on those living land shadow death light has dawned You have enlarged nation increased its joy people rejoice before You they rejoice harvest time men rejoice dividing plunder day Midian You have shattered yoke their burden bar across their shoulders rod their oppressor every trampling boot battle every garment rolled blood will burned fuel fire unto us child born unto us son given government will upon His shoulders He will called Wonderful Counselor Mighty God Everlasting Father Prince Peace increase His government peace there will no end He will reign on throne David over his kingdom establish sustain justice righteousness from time forevermore zeal LORD Hosts will accomplish this Lord has sent message against Jacob has fallen upon Israel All people will know Ephraim dwellers Samaria pride arrogance heart they will say bricks have fallen but we will rebuild finished stone sycamores have been felled but we will replace them cedars LORD has raised up foes Rezin against him joined his enemies together Aram from east Philistia from west have devoured Israel open mouths Despite all this His anger not turned away His hand still upraised But people did not return Him who struck them they did not seek LORD Hosts So LORD will cut off Israel head tail both palm branch reed single day head elder honorable man tail prophet who teaches lies those who guide this people mislead them those they mislead swallowed up Therefore Lord takes no pleasure their young men He has no compassion on their fatherless widows every one them godless wicked every mouth speaks folly Despite all this His anger not turned away His hand still upraised wickedness burns like fire consumes thorns briers kindles forest thickets which roll upward billows smoke By wrath LORD Hosts land scorched people fuel fire No man even spares his brother They carve out what on right but they still hungry they eat what on left but they still not satisfied Each one devours flesh his own offspring Manasseh devours Ephraim Ephraim Manasseh together they turn against Judah Despite all this His anger not turned away His hand still upraised Woe those who enact unjust statutes issue oppressive decrees deprive poor fair treatment withhold justice from oppressed My people make widows their prey orphans their plunder What will you do on day reckoning when devastation comes from afar whom will you flee help Where will you leave your wealth Nothing will remain but crouch among captives or fall among slain Despite all this His anger not turned away His hand still upraised Woe Assyria rod My anger staff their hands My wrath I will send him against godless nation I will dispatch him against people destined My rage take spoils seize plunder trample them down like clay streets But this not his intention this not his plan his heart destroy cut off many nations not all my commanders kings he says not Calno like Carchemish not Hamath like Arpad not Samaria like Damascus my hand seized idolatrous kingdoms whose images surpassed those Jerusalem Samaria I have done Samaria its idols will I not also do Jerusalem her idols So when Lord has completed all His work against Mount Zion Jerusalem He will say I will punish king Assyria fruit his arrogant heart proud look his eyes he says By strength my hand I have done this by my wisdom I am clever I have removed boundaries nations plundered their treasures like mighty one I subdued their rulers My hand reached into nest seize wealth nations Like one gathering abandoned eggs I gathered all earth No wing fluttered no beak opened or chirped Does axe raise itself above one who swings Does saw boast over him who saws would like rod waving one who lifts or staff lifting him who not wood Therefore Lord GOD Hosts will send wasting disease among Assyria stout warriors under his pomp will kindled fire like burning flame Light Israel will become fire its Holy One flame single day will burn devour Assyria thorns thistles splendor its forests orchards both soul body will completely destroy sickness consumes man remaining trees its forests will so few child could count them On day remnant Israel survivors house Jacob will no longer depend on him who struck them but they will truly rely on LORD Holy One Israel remnant will return remnant Jacob Mighty God Though your people O

Assyria sent great king But he cannot cure you or heal your wound I am like lion Ephraim like young lion house Judah I even I will tear them pieces then go away I will carry them off where no one can rescue them Then I will return My place until they admit their guilt seek My face their affliction they will earnestly seek Me Come let us return LORD He has torn us pieces but He will heal us He has

appear He will come us like rain like spring showers water earth What shall I do you O Ephraim What shall I do you O Judah your loyalty like morning mist like early dew vanishes Therefore I have hewn them by prophets I have slain them by words My mouth My judgments go forth like lightning I desire mercy not sacrifice knowledge God rather than burnt offerings But they like Adam have transgressed covenant there they unfaithful Me Gilead city evildoers tracked footprints blood Like raiders who lie ambush so does band priests they murder on way Shechem surely they have committed atrocities house Israel I have seen horrible thing Ephraim practices prostitution there Israel defiled Also you O Judah harvest appointed when I restore My people from captivity When I heal Israel iniquity Ephraim

kings fall not one them calls upon Me Ephraim mixes nations Ephraim unturned cake Foreigners consume his strength but he does not notice Even his hair streaked gray but he does not know Israel arrogance testifies against them yet they do not return LORD their God despite all this they do not seek Him So Ephraim has become like silly senseless dove calling out Egypt then turning Assyria they go I will spread My net over them I will bring them down like birds air I will chastise them when I hear them flocking together Woe them they have strayed from Me Destruction them they have rebelled against Me Though I would redeem them they speak lies against Me They do not cry out Me from their hearts when they wail upon their beds They slash themselves grain new wine but turn away from Me Although I trained strengthened their arms they plot evil against Me They turn but not Most High they like faulty bow Their leaders will fall by sword cursing their tongue this they will ridiculed land Egypt Put ram horn your lips eagle looms over house LORD because people have transgressed My covenant rebelled against My law Israel cries out Me O our God we know You But Israel has rejected good enemy will pursue him They set up kings but not by Me They make princes but without My approval their silver gold they make themselves idols their own destruction He has rejected your calf O Samaria My anger burns against them How long will they incapable innocence this thing from Israel craftsman made not God will broken pieces calf Samaria they sow wind they shall reap whirlwind There

donkey on its own Ephraim has hired lovers Though they hire allies among nations I will now round them up they will begin diminish under oppression king princes Though Ephraim multiplied altars sin they became his altars sinning Though I wrote them great things My law they regarded them something strange Though they offer sacrifices gifts Me though they eat meat LORD does not accept them Now He will remember their iniquity punish their sins They will return Egypt Israel has forgotten his Maker built palaces Judah has multiplied its fortified cities But I will send fire upon their cities will consume their citadels Do not rejoice O Israel exultation like nations you have played harlot against your God you have made love hire on every threshing floor threshing floor winepress will not feed them new wine will fail them They will not remain land LORD Ephraim will return Egypt eat unclean food Assyria They will not pour out wine offerings LORD their sacrifices will not please Him but will them like bread mourners all who eat will defiled their bread will themselves will not enter house LORD What will you do on appointed day on day LORD feast even if they flee destruction Egypt will gather them Memphis will bury them Their precious silver will taken over by thistles thorns will overrun their tents days punishment have come days retribution have arrived let Israel know prophet called fool inspired man insane because greatness your iniquity hostility prophet Ephraim watchman along my God yet snare fowler lies on all his paths Hostility house his God They have deeply corrupted themselves days Gibeah He will remember their guilt He will punish their sins I found Israel like grapes wilderness I saw your fathers firstfruits fig tree its first season But they went Baal peor consecrated themselves Shame so they became detestable thing they loved Ephraim glory will fly away like bird no birth no pregnancy no conception Even if they raise their children I will bereave them each one Yes woe them when I turn away from them I have seen Ephraim like Tyre planted meadow But Ephraim will bring out his children slaughter Give them O LORD what will You give Give them wombs miscarry breasts dry up All their evil appears Gilgal there I hated them I will drive them from My house wickedness their deeds I will no longer love them all their leaders rebellious

among nations Israel luxuriant vine yielding fruit himself more his fruit increased more he increased altars better his land produced better he made sacred pillars Their hearts devious now they must bear their guilt LORD will break down their altars demolish their sacred pillars Surely now they will say We have no king we do not revere LORD What can king do us They speak mere words false oaths

darkness have seen great light on those living land shadow death light has dawned From time on Jesus began preach Repent kingdom heaven near Jesus walking beside Sea Galilee He saw two brothers Simon called Peter his brother Andrew They casting net into sea they fishermen Come follow Me Jesus said I will make you fishers men once they left their nets followed Him Going on from there He saw two other brothers James son Zebedee his brother John They boat their father Zebedee mending their nets Jesus called them immediately they left boat their father followed Him Jesus went throughout Galilee

acute pain demon possessed those having seizures paralyzed He healed them large crowds followed Him came from Galilee Decapolis Jerusalem Judea beyond Jordan When Jesus saw crowds He went up on mountain sat down His disciples came Him He began teach them saying Blessed poor spirit theirs kingdom heaven Blessed those who mourn they will comforted Blessed meek they will inherit earth Blessed those who hunger thirst righteousness they will filled Blessed merciful they will shown mercy Blessed pure heart they will see God Blessed peacemakers they will called sons God Blessed those who persecuted because righteousness theirs kingdom heaven Blessed you when people insult you persecute you falsely say all kinds evil against you because Me Rejoice glad because great your reward heaven same way they persecuted prophets before you You salt earth But if salt loses its savor how can made salty again no longer good anything except thrown out trampled by men You light world city on hill cannot hidden Neither do people light lamp put under basket Instead they set on stand gives light everyone house same way let your light shine before men they may see your good deeds glorify your Father heaven Do not think I have come abolish Law or Prophets I have not come abolish them but fulfill them I tell you truly until heaven earth pass away not single jot not stroke pen will disappear from Law until everything accomplished So then whoever breaks one least these commandments teaches others do likewise will called least kingdom heaven but whoever practices teaches them will called great kingdom heaven I tell you unless your righteousness exceeds scribes Pharisees you will never enter kingdom heaven You have heard said ancients Do not murder Anyone who murders will subject judgment But I tell you anyone who angry his brother will subject judgment Again anyone who says his brother Raca will subject Sanhedrin But anyone who says You fool will subject fire hell So if you offering your gift altar there remember your brother has something against you leave your gift there before altar First go reconciled your brother then come offer your gift Reconcile quickly your adversary while you still on way court Otherwise he may hand you over judge judge may hand you over officer you may thrown into prison Truly I tell you you will not get out until you have paid last penny You have heard said Do not commit adultery But I tell you anyone who looks woman lust after her has already committed adultery her his heart If your right eye causes you sin gouge out throw away better you lose one part your body than your whole body thrown into hell if your right hand causes you sin cut off throw away better you lose one part your body than your whole body depart into hell has also been said Whoever divorces his wife must give her certificate divorce But I tell you anyone who divorces his wife except sexual immorality brings adultery upon her he who marries divorced woman commits adultery Again you have heard said ancients Do not break your oath but fulfill your vows Lord But I tell you not swear all either by heaven God throne or by earth His footstool or by Jerusalem city great King Nor should you swear by your head you cannot make single hair white or black Simply let your Yes Yes your No No Anything more comes from evil one You have heard said Eye eye tooth tooth But I tell you not resist evil person If someone slaps you on your right cheek turn him other also if someone wants sue you take your tunic let him have your cloak well if someone forces you go one mile go him two miles Give one who asks you do not turn away from one who wants borrow from you You have heard said Love your neighbor Hate your enemy But I tell you love your enemies pray those who persecute you you may sons your Father heaven He causes His sun rise on evil good sends rain on righteous unrighteous If you love those who love you what reward will you get Do not even tax collectors do same if you greet only your brothers what you doing more than others Do not even Gentiles do same perfect therefore your heavenly Father perfect careful not perform your righteous acts before men seen by them If you do you will have no reward from your Father heaven So when you give needy do not sound trumpet before you hypocrites do synagogues on streets honored by men Truly I tell you they already have their full reward But when you give needy do not let your left hand know what your right hand doing so your giving may secret your Father who sees what done secret will reward you when you pray do not like hypocrites they love pray standing synagogues on street corners seen by men Truly I tell you they already have their full reward But when you pray go into your inner room shut your door pray your Father who unseen your Father who sees what done secret will reward you when you pray do not babble on like pagans they think by their many words they will heard Do not like them your Father knows what you need before you ask Him So then this how you should pray Our Father heaven hallowed Your name Your kingdom come Your will done on earth heaven Give us this day our daily bread forgive us our debts we also have forgiven our debtors lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil one if you forgive men their trespasses your heavenly Father will also forgive you But if you do not forgive men their trespasses neither will your Father forgive yours When you fast do not somber like hypocrites they disfigure their faces show men they fasting Truly I tell you they already have their full reward But when you fast anoint your head wash your face so your fasting will not obvious men but only your Father who unseen your Father who sees what done secret will reward you Do not store up yourselves treasures on earth where moth rust destroy where thieves break steal But store up yourselves treasures heaven where moth rust do not destroy where thieves do not break steal where your treasure there your heart will also eye lamp body If your eyes good your whole body will full light But if your eyes bad your whole body will full darkness If then light within you darkness how great darkness No one can serve two masters Either he will hate one love other or he will devoted one despise other You cannot serve both God money Therefore I tell you do not worry about your life what you will eat or drink or about your body what you will wear not life more than food body more than clothes Look birds air They do not sow or reap or gather into barns yet your heavenly Father feeds them you not much more valuable than they Who you by worrying can add single hour his life why do you worry about clothes Consider how lilies field grow They do not labor or spin Yet I tell you not even Solomon all his glory adorned like one these If how God clothes grass field which here today tomorrow thrown into furnace will He not much more clothe you O you little faith Therefore do not worry saying What shall we eat or What shall we drink or What shall we wear Gentiles strive after all these things your heavenly Father knows you need them But seek first kingdom God His righteousness all these things will added unto you Therefore do not worry about tomorrow tomorrow will worry about itself Today has enough trouble its own Do not judge or you will judged same judgment you pronounce you will judged measure you use will measured you Why do you look speck your brother eye but fail notice beam your own eye How can you say your brother Let me take speck out your eye while there still beam your own eye You hypocrite First take beam out your own eye then you will see clearly remove speck from your brother eye Do not give dogs what holy do not throw your pearls before swine If you do they may trample them under their feet then turn tear you pieces Ask will given you seek you will find knock door will opened you everyone who asks receives he who seeks finds him who knocks door will opened Which you if his son asks bread will give him stone Or if he asks fish will give him snake So if you who evil know how give good gifts your children how much more will your Father heaven give good things those who ask Him everything then do others you would have them do you this essence Law Prophets Enter through narrow gate wide gate broad way leads destruction many enter through But small gate narrow way leads life only few find Beware false prophets They come you sheep clothing but inwardly they ravenous wolves By their fruit you will recognize them grapes gathered from thornbushes or figs from thistles Likewise every good tree bears good fruit but bad tree bears bad fruit good tree cannot bear bad fruit bad tree cannot bear good fruit Every tree does not bear good fruit cut down thrown into fire So then by their fruit you will recognize them Not everyone who says Me Lord Lord will enter kingdom heaven but only he who does will My Father heaven Many will say Me on day Lord Lord did we not prophesy Your name Your name drive out demons perform many miracles Then I will tell them plainly I never knew you depart from Me you workers lawlessness Therefore everyone who hears these words Mine acts on them like wise man who built his house on rock rain fell torrents raged winds blew beat against house yet did not fall because its foundation on rock But everyone who hears these words Mine does not act on them like foolish man who built his house on sand rain fell torrents raged winds blew beat against house fell great its collapse When Jesus had finished saying these things crowds astonished His teaching because He taught one who had authority not their scribes When Jesus came down from mountain large crowds followed Him Suddenly leper came knelt before Him saying Lord if You willing You can make me clean Jesus reached out His hand touched man I am willing He said clean immediately his leprosy cleansed Then Jesus instructed him See you dont tell anyone But go show yourself priest offer gift prescribed by Moses testimony them When Jesus had entered Capernaum centurion came pleaded Him Lord my servant lies home paralyzed terrible agony I will go heal him Jesus replied centurion answered Lord I am not worthy have You come under my roof But just say word my servant will healed I myself am man under authority soldiers under me I tell one go he goes another come he comes I tell my servant do something he does When Jesus heard this He marveled said those following Him Truly I tell you I have not found anyone Israel such great faith I say you many will come from east west share banquet Abraham Isaac Jacob kingdom heaven But sons kingdom will thrown into outer darkness where there will weeping gnashing teeth Then Jesus said centurion Go you have believed so will done you his servant healed very hour When Jesus arrived Peter house He saw Peter mother law sick bed fever So He touched her hand fever left her she got up began serve them When evening came many who demon possessed brought Jesus He drove out spirits word healed all sick This fulfill what spoken through prophet Isaiah He took on our infirmities carried our diseases When Jesus saw large crowd around Him He gave orders cross other side sea one scribes came Him said Teacher I will follow You wherever You go Jesus replied Foxes have dens birds air have nests but Son Man has no place lay His head Another His disciples requested Lord first let me go bury my father But Jesus told him Follow Me let dead bury their own dead When He got into boat His disciples followed Him Suddenly violent storm came up on sea so boat engulfed by waves but Jesus sleeping disciples went woke Him saying Lord save us We perishing You little faith Jesus replied why you so afraid Then He got up rebuked winds sea perfectly calm men amazed asked What kind man this Even winds sea obey Him When Jesus arrived on other side region Gadarenes He met by two demon possessed men coming from tombs They so violent no one could pass way What do You want us Son God they shouted Have You come here torture us before appointed time distance large herd pigs feeding So demons begged Jesus If You drive us out send us into herd pigs Go He told them So they came out went into pigs whole herd rushed down steep bank into sea died waters Those tending pigs ran off into town reported all this including account demon possessed men Then whole town went out meet Jesus when they saw Him they begged Him leave their region Jesus got into boat crossed over came His own town Just then some men brought Him paralytic lying on mat When Jesus saw their faith He said paralytic Take courage son your sins forgiven On seeing this some scribes said themselves This man blaspheming But Jesus knew what they thinking said Why do you harbor evil your hearts Which easier say Your sins forgiven or say Get up walk But so you may know Son Man has authority on earth forgive sins Then He said paralytic Get up pick up your mat go home man got up went home When crowds saw this they filled awe glorified God who had given such authority men Jesus went on from there He saw man named Matthew sitting tax booth Follow Me He told him Matthew got up followed Him Later Jesus dining Matthew house many tax collectors sinners came ate Him His disciples When Pharisees saw this they asked His disciples Why does your Teacher eat tax collectors sinners On hearing this Jesus said not healthy who need doctor but sick But go learn what this means I desire mercy not sacrifice I have not come call righteous but sinners time John disciples came Jesus asked Why we Pharisees fast so often but Your disciples do not fast Jesus replied How can guests bridegroom mourn while He them But time will come when bridegroom will taken from them then they will fast No one sews patch unshrunk cloth on old garment patch will pull away from garment worse tear will result Neither do men pour new wine into old wineskins If they do skins will burst wine will spill wineskins will ruined Instead they pour new wine into new wineskins both preserved While Jesus saying these things synagogue leader came knelt before Him My daughter has just died he said But come place Your hand on her she will live So Jesus got up went him along His disciples Suddenly woman who had suffered from bleeding twelve years came up behind Him touched fringe His cloak She said herself If only I touch His cloak I will healed Jesus turned saw her Take courage daughter He said your faith has healed you woman cured from very hour When Jesus entered house synagogue leader He saw flute players noisy crowd Go away He told them girl not dead but asleep they laughed Him After crowd had been put outside Jesus went took girl by hand she got up news about this spread throughout region Jesus went on from there two blind men followed Him crying out Have mercy on us Son David After Jesus had entered house blind men came Him Do you believe I am able do this He asked Yes Lord they answered Then He touched their eyes said According your faith will done you their eyes opened Jesus warned them sternly See no one finds out about this But they went out spread news about Him throughout land they leaving demon possessed man who mute brought Jesus when demon had been driven out man began speak crowds amazed said Nothing like this has ever been seen Israel But Pharisees said by prince demons He drives out demons Jesus went through all towns villages teaching their synagogues preaching gospel kingdom healing every disease sickness When He saw crowds He moved compassion them because they harassed helpless like sheep without shepherd Then He said His disciples harvest plentiful but workers few Ask Lord harvest therefore send out workers into His harvest calling His twelve disciples Him Jesus gave them authority over unclean spirits so they could drive them out heal every disease sickness These names twelve apostles first Simon called Peter his brother Andrew James son Zebedee his brother John Philip Bartholomew Thomas Matthew tax collector James son Alphaeus Thaddaeus Simon Zealot Judas Iscariot who betrayed Jesus These twelve Jesus sent out following instructions Do not go onto road Gentiles or enter any town Samaritans Go rather lost sheep Israel you go preach this message kingdom heaven near Heal sick raise dead cleanse lepers drive out demons Freely you have received freely give Do not carry any gold or silver or copper your belts Take no bag road or second tunic or sandals or staff worker worthy his provisions Whatever town or village you enter find out who worthy there stay his house until you move on you enter home greet its occupants If home worthy let your peace rest on but if not let your peace return you if anyone will not welcome you or heed your words shake dust off your feet when you leave home or town Truly I tell you will more bearable Sodom Gomorrah on day judgment than town Behold I am sending you out like sheep among wolves therefore shrewd snakes innocent doves But beware men they will hand you over their councils flog you their synagogues On My account you will brought before governors kings witnesses them Gentiles But when they hand you over do not worry about how respond or what say hour you will given what say will not you speaking but Spirit your Father speaking through you Brother will betray brother death father his child children will rise against their parents have them put death You will hated by everyone because My name but one who perseveres end will saved When they persecute you one town flee next Truly I tell you you will not reach all towns Israel before Son Man comes disciple not above his teacher nor servant above his master enough disciple like his teacher servant like his master If head house has been called Beelzebul how much more members his household So do not afraid them there nothing concealed will not

members his own household Anyone who loves his father or mother more than Me not worthy Me anyone who loves his son or daughter more than Me not worthy Me anyone who does not take up his cross follow Me not worthy Me Whoever finds his life will lose whoever loses his life My sake will find He who receives you receives Me he who receives Me receives One who sent Me Whoever receives prophet because he prophet will receive prophet reward whoever receives righteous man because he righteous man will receive righteous man reward if anyone gives even cup cold water one these little ones because he My disciple truly I tell you he will never lose his reward After Jesus had finished instructing His twelve disciples He went on from there teach preach their cities Meanwhile John heard prison about works Christ he sent his disciples ask Him You One who come or should we look someone else Jesus replied Go back report John what you hear see blind receive sight lame walk lepers cleansed deaf hear dead raised good news preached poor Blessed one who does not fall away on account Me John disciples leaving Jesus began speak crowds about John What did you go out into wilderness see reed swaying wind Otherwise what did you go out see man dressed fine clothes Look those who wear fine clothing found kings palaces What then did you go out see prophet Yes I tell you more than prophet This one about whom written Behold I will send My messenger ahead You who will prepare Your way before You Truly I tell you among those born women there has risen no one greater than John Baptist Yet even least kingdom heaven greater than he From days John Baptist until now kingdom heaven has been subject violence violent lay claim all Prophets Law prophesied until John if you willing accept he Elijah who come He who has ears let him hear what can I compare this generation They like children sitting marketplaces calling out others We played flute you you did not dance we sang dirge you did not mourn John came neither eating nor drinking they say He has demon Son Man came eating drinking they say Look this glutton drunkard friend tax collectors sinners But wisdom vindicated by her actions Then Jesus began denounce cities which most His miracles had been performed because they did not repent Woe you Chorazin Woe you Bethsaida if miracles performed you had been performed Tyre Sidon they would have repented long ago sackcloth ashes But I tell you will more bearable Tyre Sidon on day judgment than you you Capernaum will you lifted up heaven No you will brought down Hades if miracles performed you had been performed Sodom would have remained this day But I tell you will more bearable Sodom on day judgment than you time Jesus declared I praise You Father Lord heaven earth because You have hidden these things from wise learned revealed them little children Yes Father this well pleasing Your sight All things have been entrusted Me by My Father No one knows Son except Father no one knows Father except Son those whom Son chooses reveal Him Come Me all you who weary burdened I will give you rest Take My yoke upon you learn from Me I am gentle humble heart you will find rest your souls My yoke easy My burden light time Jesus went through grainfields on Sabbath His disciples hungry began pick heads grain eat them When Pharisees saw this they said Him Look Your disciples doing what unlawful on Sabbath Jesus replied Have you not read what David did when he his companions hungry He entered house God he his companions ate consecrated bread which not lawful them eat but only priests Or havent you read Law on Sabbath priests temple break Sabbath yet innocent But I tell you something greater than temple here If only you had known meaning I desire mercy not sacrifice you would not have condemned innocent Son Man Lord Sabbath Moving on from there Jesus entered their synagogue man withered hand there order accuse Jesus they asked Him lawful heal on Sabbath He replied If one you has sheep falls into pit on Sabbath will he not take hold lift out How much more valuable man than sheep Therefore lawful do good on Sabbath Then Jesus said man Stretch out your hand So he stretched out restored full use just like other But Pharisees went out plotted how they might kill Jesus Aware this Jesus withdrew from place Large crowds followed Him He healed them all warning them not make Him known This fulfill what spoken through prophet Isaiah Here My Servant whom I have chosen My beloved whom My soul delights I will put My Spirit on Him He will proclaim justice nations He will not quarrel or cry out no one will hear His voice streets bruised reed He will not break smoldering wick He will not extinguish till He leads justice victory His name nations will put their hope Then demon possessed man who blind mute brought Jesus He healed man so he could speak see crowds astounded asked Could this Son David But when Pharisees heard this they said Only by Beelzebul prince demons does this man drive out demons Knowing their thoughts Jesus said them Every kingdom divided against itself will laid waste every city or household divided against itself will not stand If Satan drives out Satan he divided against himself How then can his kingdom stand if I drive out demons by Beelzebul by whom do your sons drive them out So then they will your judges But if I drive out demons by Spirit God then kingdom God has come upon you Or again how can anyone enter strong man house steal his possessions unless he first ties up strong man Then he can plunder his house He who not Me against Me he who does not gather Me scatters Therefore I tell you every sin blasphemy will forgiven men but blasphemy against Spirit will not forgiven Whoever speaks word against Son Man will forgiven but whoever speaks against Holy Spirit will not forgiven either this age or one come Make tree good its fruit will good or make tree bad its fruit will bad tree known by its fruit You brood vipers how can you who evil say anything good out overflow heart mouth speaks good man brings good things out his good store treasure evil man brings evil things out his evil store treasure But I tell you men will give account on day judgment every careless word they have spoken by your words you will acquitted by your words you will condemned Then some scribes Pharisees said Him Teacher we want see sign from You Jesus replied wicked adulterous generation demands sign but none will given except sign prophet Jonah Jonah three days three nights belly great fish so Son Man will three days three nights heart earth men Nineveh will stand judgment this generation condemn they repented preaching Jonah now One greater than Jonah here Queen South will rise judgment this generation condemn she came from ends earth hear wisdom Solomon now One greater than Solomon here When unclean spirit comes out man passes through arid places seeking rest does not find Then says I will return house I left On its return finds house vacant swept clean put order Then goes brings seven other spirits more wicked than itself they go dwell there final plight man worse than first So will this wicked generation While Jesus still speaking crowds His mother brothers stood outside wanting speak Him Someone told Him Look Your mother brothers standing outside wanting speak You But Jesus replied Who My mother who My brothers Pointing His disciples He said Here My mother My brothers whoever does will My Father heaven My brother sister mother same day Jesus went out house sat by sea Such large crowds gathered around Him He got into boat sat down while all people stood on shore He told them many things parables saying farmer went out sow his seed he sowing some seed fell along path birds came devoured Some fell on rocky ground where did not have much soil sprang up quickly because soil shallow But when sun rose seedlings scorched they withered because they had no root Other seed fell among thorns which grew up choked seedlings Still other seed fell on good soil produced crop hundredfold sixtyfold or thirtyfold He who has ears let him hear Then disciples came Jesus asked Why do You speak people parables He replied knowledge mysteries kingdom heaven has been given you but not them Whoever has will given more he will have abundance Whoever does not have even what he has will taken away from him This why I speak them parables Though seeing they do not see though hearing they do not hear or understand them prophecy Isaiah fulfilled You will ever hearing but never understanding you will ever seeing but never perceiving this people heart has grown callous they hardly hear their ears they have closed their eyes Otherwise they might see their eyes hear their ears understand their hearts turn I would heal them But blessed your eyes because they see your ears because they hear truly I tell you many prophets righteous men longed see what you see but did not see hear what you hear but did not hear Consider then parable sower When anyone hears message kingdom but does not understand evil one comes snatches away what sown his heart This seed sown along path seed sown on rocky ground one who hears word once receives joy But since he has no root he remains only season When trouble or persecution comes because word he quickly falls away seed sown among thorns one who hears word but worries this life deceitfulness wealth choke word becomes unfruitful But seed sown on good soil one who hears word understands He indeed bears fruit produces crop hundredfold sixtyfold or thirtyfold Jesus put before them another parable kingdom heaven like man who sowed good seed his field But while everyone asleep his enemy came sowed weeds among wheat slipped away When wheat sprouted bore grain then weeds also appeared owner servants came him said Sir didnt you sow good seed your field Where then did weeds come from enemy did this he replied So servants asked him Do you want us go pull them up No he said if you pull weeds now you might uproot wheat them Let both grow together until harvest time I will tell harvesters First collect weeds tie them bundles burned then gather wheat into my barn He put before them another parable kingdom heaven like mustard seed man planted his field Although smallest all seeds yet grows into largest garden plants becomes tree so birds air come nest its branches He told them still another parable kingdom heaven like leaven woman took mixed into three measures flour until all leavened Jesus spoke all these things crowds parables He did not tell them anything without using parable So fulfilled what spoken through prophet I will open My mouth parables I will utter things hidden since foundation world Then Jesus dismissed crowds went into house His disciples came Him said Explain us parable weeds field He replied One who sows good seed Son Man field world good seed represents sons kingdom weeds sons evil one enemy who sows them devil harvest end age harvesters angels weeds collected burned fire so will end age Son Man will send out His angels they will weed out His kingdom every cause sin all who practice lawlessness they will throw them into fiery furnace where there will weeping gnashing teeth Then righteous will shine like sun kingdom their Father He who has ears let him hear kingdom heaven like treasure hidden field When man found he hid again his joy he went sold all he had bought field Again kingdom heaven like merchant search fine pearls When he found one very precious pearl he went away sold all he had bought Once again kingdom heaven like net cast into sea caught all kinds fish When full men pulled ashore Then they sat down sorted good fish into containers but threw bad away So will end age angels will come separate wicked from righteous throw them into fiery furnace where there will weeping gnashing teeth Have you understood all these things Yes they answered Then He told them this reason every scribe who has been discipled kingdom heaven like homeowner who brings out his storeroom new treasures well old When Jesus had finished these parables He withdrew from place Coming His hometown He taught people their synagogue they astonished Where did this man get such wisdom miraculous powers they asked Isnt this carpenter son Isnt His mother name Mary arent His brothers James Joseph Simon Judas Arent all His sisters us well Where then did this man get all these things they took offense Him But Jesus said them Only his hometown his own household prophet without honor He did not do many miracles there because their unbelief time Herod tetrarch heard reports about Jesus said his servants This John Baptist he has risen from dead why miraculous powers work him Now Herod had arrested John bound him put him prison on account Herodias his brother Philip wife because John had been telling him not lawful you have her Although Herod wanted kill John he afraid people because they regarded John prophet On Herod birthday however daughter Herodias danced before them pleased Herod so much he promised oath give her whatever she asked Prompted by her mother she said Give me here on platter head John Baptist king grieved but because his oaths his guests he ordered her wish granted sent have John beheaded prison John head brought on platter presented girl who carried her mother Then John disciples came took his body buried they went informed Jesus When Jesus heard about John He withdrew by boat privately solitary place But crowds found out about followed Him on foot from towns When He stepped ashore saw large crowd He had compassion on them healed their sick When evening came disciples came Him said This desolate place hour already late Dismiss crowds so they can go villages buy themselves some food They do not need go away Jesus replied You give them something eat We have here only five loaves bread two fish they answered Bring them here Me Jesus said He directed crowds sit down on grass Taking five loaves two fish looking up heaven He spoke blessing Then He broke loaves gave them disciples disciples gave them people They all ate satisfied disciples picked up twelve basketfuls broken pieces left over About five thousand men fed addition women children Immediately Jesus made disciples get into boat go on ahead Him other side while He dismissed crowds After He had sent them away He went up on mountain by Himself pray When evening came He there alone but boat already far from land buffeted by waves because wind against During fourth watch night Jesus went out them walking on sea When disciples saw Him walking on sea they terrified ghost they said cried out fear But Jesus spoke up once Take courage I Do not afraid Lord if You Peter replied command me come You on water Come said Jesus Then Peter got down out boat walked on water came toward Jesus But when he saw strength wind he afraid beginning sink cried out Lord save me Immediately Jesus reached out His hand took hold Peter You little faith He said why did you doubt when they had climbed back into boat wind died down Then those who boat worshiped Him saying Truly You Son God When they had crossed over they landed Gennesaret when men place recognized Jesus they sent word all surrounding region People brought all sick Him begged Him just let them touch fringe His cloak all who touched Him healed Then some Pharisees scribes came Jesus from Jerusalem asked Why do Your disciples break tradition elders They do not wash their hands before they eat Jesus replied why do you break command God sake your tradition God said Honor your father mother Anyone who curses his father or mother must put death But you say if anyone says his father or mother Whatever you would have received from me gift devoted God he need not honor his father or mother Thus you nullify word God sake your tradition You hypocrites Isaiah prophesied correctly about you These people honor Me their lips but their hearts far from Me They worship Me vain they teach doctrine precepts men Jesus called crowd Him said Listen understand man not defiled by what enters his mouth but by what comes out Then disciples came Him said You aware Pharisees offended when they heard this But Jesus replied Every plant My heavenly Father has not planted will pulled up by its roots Disregard them They blind guides If blind man leads blind man both will fall into pit Peter said Him Explain this parable us Do you still not understand Jesus asked Do you not yet realize whatever enters mouth goes into stomach then eliminated But things come out mouth come from heart these things defile man out heart come evil thoughts murder adultery sexual immorality theft false testimony slander These what defile man but eating unwashed hands does not defile him Leaving place Jesus withdrew district Tyre Sidon Canaanite woman from region came Him crying out Lord Son David have mercy on me My daughter miserably possessed by demon But Jesus did not answer word So His disciples came urged Him Send her away she keeps crying out after us He answered I sent only lost sheep house Israel woman came knelt before Him Lord help me she said But Jesus replied not right take children bread toss dogs Yes Lord she said even dogs eat crumbs fall from their master table O woman Jesus answered your faith great Let done you you desire her daughter healed from very hour Moving on from there Jesus went along Sea Galilee Then He went up on mountain sat down Large crowds came Him bringing lame blind crippled mute many others laid them His feet He healed them crowd amazed when they saw mute speaking crippled restored lame walking blind seeing they glorified God Israel Then Jesus called His disciples Him said I have compassion this crowd because they have already been Me three days have nothing eat I do not want send them away hungry or they may faint along way disciples replied Where this desolate place could we find enough bread feed such large crowd How many loaves do you have Jesus asked Seven they replied few small fish He instructed crowd sit down on ground Taking seven loaves fish He gave thanks broke them Then He gave them disciples disciples gave them people They all ate satisfied disciples picked up seven basketfuls broken pieces left over total four thousand men fed addition women children After Jesus had dismissed crowds He got into boat went region Magadan Then Pharisees Sadducees came tested Jesus by asking Him show them sign from heaven But He replied When evening comes you say weather will fair sky red morning Today will stormy sky red overcast You know how interpret appearance sky but not signs times wicked adulterous generation demands sign but none will given except sign Jonah Then He left them went away When they crossed other side disciples forgot take bread Watch out Jesus told them Beware leaven Pharisees Sadducees They discussed this among themselves concluded because we did not bring any bread Aware their conversation Jesus said You little faith why you debating among yourselves about having no bread Do you still not understand Do you not remember five loaves five thousand how many basketfuls you gathered Or seven loaves four thousand how many basketfuls you gathered How do you not understand I not telling you about bread But beware leaven Pharisees Sadducees Then they understood He not telling them beware leaven used bread but teaching Pharisees Sadducees When Jesus came region Caesarea Philippi He questioned His disciples Who do people say Son Man They replied Some say John Baptist others say Elijah still others Jeremiah or one prophets But what about you Jesus asked Who do you say I am Simon Peter answered You Christ Son living God Jesus replied Blessed you Simon son Jonah this not revealed you by flesh blood but by My Father heaven I tell you you Peter on this rock I will build My church gates Hades will not prevail against I will give you keys kingdom heaven Whatever you bind on earth will bound heaven whatever you loose on earth will loosed heaven Then He admonished disciples not tell anyone He Christ From time on Jesus began show His disciples He must go Jerusalem suffer many things hands elders chief priests scribes He must killed on third day raised life Peter took Him aside began rebuke Him Far from You Lord he said This shall never happen You But Jesus turned said Peter Get behind Me Satan You stumbling block Me you do not have mind things God but things men Then Jesus told His disciples If anyone wants come after Me he must deny himself take up his cross follow Me whoever wants save his life will lose but whoever loses his life My sake will find What will profit man if he gains whole world yet forfeits his soul Or what can man give exchange his soul Son Man will come His Father glory His angels then He will repay each one according what he has done Truly I tell you some who standing here will not taste death before they see Son Man coming His kingdom After six days Jesus took Him Peter James John brother James led them up high mountain by themselves There He transfigured before them His face shone like sun His clothes became white light Suddenly Moses Elijah appeared before them talking Jesus Peter said Jesus Lord good us here If You wish I will put up three shelters one You one Moses one Elijah While Peter still speaking bright cloud enveloped them voice from cloud said This My beloved Son whom I am well pleased Listen Him When disciples heard this they fell facedown terror Then Jesus came over touched them Get up He said Do not afraid when they looked up they saw no one except Jesus they coming down mountain Jesus commanded them Do not tell anyone about this vision until Son Man has been raised from dead disciples asked Him Why then do scribes say Elijah must come first Jesus replied Elijah does indeed come he will restore all things But I tell you Elijah has already come they did not recognize him but have done him whatever they wished same way Son Man will suffer their hands Then disciples understood He speaking them about John Baptist When they came crowd man came up Jesus knelt before Him Lord have mercy on my son he said He has seizures suffering terribly He often falls into fire or into water I brought him Your disciples but they could not heal him O unbelieving perverse generation Jesus replied How long must I remain you How long must I put up you Bring boy here Me Then Jesus rebuked demon came out boy he healed from moment Afterward disciples came Jesus privately asked Why couldnt we drive out Because you have so little faith He answered truly I tell you if you have faith size mustard seed you can say this mountain Move from here there will move Nothing will impossible you When they gathered together Galilee Jesus told them Son Man about delivered into hands men They will kill Him on third day He will raised life disciples deeply grieved After they had arrived Capernaum collectors two drachma tax came Peter asked Does your Teacher pay two drachmas Yes he answered When Peter entered house Jesus preempted him What do you think Simon He asked From whom do kings earth collect customs taxes from their own sons or from others From others Peter answered Then sons exempt Jesus declared But so we may not offend them go sea cast hook take first fish you catch When you open its mouth you will find four drachma coin Take give them My tax yours time disciples came Jesus asked Who then greatest kingdom heaven Jesus invited little child stand among them Truly I tell you He said unless you change become like little children you will never enter kingdom heaven Therefore whoever humbles himself like this little child greatest kingdom heaven whoever welcomes little child like this My name welcomes Me But if anyone causes one these little ones who believe Me stumble would better him have large millstone hung around his neck drowned depths sea Woe world causes sin These stumbling blocks must come but woe man through whom they come If your hand or your foot causes you sin cut off throw away better you enter life crippled or lame than have two hands two feet thrown into eternal fire if your eye causes you sin gouge out throw away better you enter life one eye than have two eyes thrown into fire hell See you do not look down on any these little ones I tell you their angels heaven always see face My Father heaven What do you think If man has hundred sheep one them goes astray will he not leave ninety nine on hills go out search one lost if he finds truly I tell you he rejoices more over one sheep than over ninety nine did not go astray same way your Father heaven not willing any these little ones should perish If your brother sins against you go confront him privately If he listens you you have won your brother over But if he will not listen take one or two others along so every matter may established by testimony two or three witnesses If he refuses listen them tell church if he refuses listen even church regard him you would pagan or tax collector Truly I tell you whatever you bind on earth will bound heaven whatever you loose on earth will loosed heaven Again I tell you truly if two you on earth agree about anything you ask will done you by My Father heaven where two or three gather together My name there am I them Then Peter came Jesus asked Lord how many times shall I forgive my brother who sins against me Up seven times Jesus answered I tell you not just seven times but seventy seven times Because this kingdom heaven like king who wanted settle accounts his servants he began settlements debtor brought him owing ten thousand talents Since man unable pay master ordered he sold pay his debt along his wife children everything he owned Then servant fell on his knees before him Have patience me he begged I will pay back everything His master had compassion on him forgave his debt released him But when servant went out he found one his fellow servants who owed him hundred denarii He grabbed him began choke him saying Pay back what you owe me So his fellow servant fell down begged him Have patience me I will pay you back But he refused Instead he went had man thrown into prison until he could pay his debt When his fellow servants saw what had happened they greatly distressed they went recounted all this their master Then master summoned him declared You wicked servant I forgave all your debt because you begged me Shouldnt you have had mercy on your fellow servant just I had on you anger his master turned him over jailers tortured until he should repay all he owed how My heavenly Father will treat each you unless you forgive your brother from your heart When Jesus had finished saying these things He left Galilee went into region Judea beyond Jordan Large crowds followed Him He healed them there Then some Pharisees came tested Him by asking lawful man divorce his wife any reason Jesus answered Have you not read from beginning Creator made them male female said this reason man will leave his father mother united his wife two will become one flesh So they no longer two but one flesh Therefore what God has joined together let man not separate Why then they asked did Moses order man give his wife certificate divorce send her away Jesus replied Moses permitted you divorce your wives because your hardness heart but not this way from beginning Now I tell you whoever divorces his wife except sexual immorality marries another woman commits adultery His disciples said Him If this case between man his wife better not marry Not everyone can accept this word He replied but only those whom has been given there eunuchs who born way others made way by men still others live like eunuchs sake kingdom heaven one who can accept this should accept Then little children brought Jesus Him place His hands on them pray them disciples rebuked those who brought them But Jesus said Let little children come Me do not hinder them kingdom heaven belongs such these after He had placed His hands on them He went on from there Just then man came up Jesus inquired Teacher what good thing must I do obtain eternal life Why do you ask Me about what good Jesus replied There only One who good If you want enter life keep commandments Which ones man asked Jesus answered Do not murder do not commit adultery do not steal do not bear false witness honor your father mother love your neighbor yourself All these I have kept said young man What do I still lack Jesus told him If you want perfect go sell your possessions give poor you will have treasure heaven Then come follow Me When young man heard this he went away sorrow because he had great wealth Then Jesus said His disciples Truly I tell you hard rich man enter kingdom heaven Again I tell you easier camel pass through eye needle than rich man enter kingdom God When disciples heard this they greatly astonished asked Who then can saved Jesus looked them said man this impossible but God all things possible Look Peter replied we have left everything follow You What then will there us Jesus said them Truly I tell you renewal all things when Son Man sits on His glorious throne you who have followed Me will also sit on twelve thrones judging twelve tribes Israel everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or fields sake My name will receive hundredfold will inherit eternal life But many who first will last last will first kingdom heaven like landowner who went out early morning hire workers his vineyard He agreed pay them denarius day sent them into his vineyard About third hour he went out saw others standing marketplace doing nothing You also go into my vineyard he said I will pay you whatever right So they went He went out again about sixth hour ninth hour did same thing About eleventh hour he went out found still others standing around Why have you been standing here all day long doing nothing he asked Because no one has hired us they answered So he told them You also go into my vineyard When evening came owner vineyard said his foreman Call workers pay them their wages starting last ones hired moving on first workers who hired about eleventh hour came each received denarius So when original workers came they assumed they would receive more But each them also received denarius On receiving their pay they began grumble against landowner These men who hired last worked only one hour they said you have made them equal us who have borne burden scorching heat day But he answered one them Friend I am not being unfair you Did you not agree me on one denarius Take your pay go I want give this last man same I gave you Do I not have right do I please what mine Or you envious because I am generous So last will first first will last Jesus going up Jerusalem He took twelve disciples aside said Look we going up Jerusalem Son Man will delivered over chief priests scribes They will condemn Him death will deliver Him over Gentiles mocked flogged crucified on third day He will raised life Then mother Zebedee sons came Jesus her sons knelt down make request Him What do you want He inquired She answered Declare Your kingdom one these two sons mine may sit Your right hand other Your left You do not know what you asking Jesus replied Can you drink cup I am going drink We can brothers answered You will indeed drink My cup Jesus said But sit My right or left not Mine grant These seats belong those whom My Father has prepared them When ten heard about this they indignant two brothers But Jesus called them aside said You know rulers Gentiles lord over them their superiors exercise authority over them shall not this way among you Instead whoever wants become great among you must your servant whoever wants first among you must your slave just Son Man did not come served but serve give His life ransom many they leaving Jericho large crowd followed Him there two blind men sitting beside road When they heard Jesus passing by they cried out Lord Son David have mercy on us crowd admonished them silent but they cried out all louder Lord Son David have mercy on us Jesus stopped called them What do you want Me do you He asked Lord they answered let our eyes opened Moved compassion Jesus touched their eyes once they received their sight followed Him they approached Jerusalem came Bethphage on Mount Olives Jesus sent out two disciples saying them Go into village ahead you once you will find donkey tied there her colt beside her Untie them bring them Me If anyone questions you tell him Lord needs them he will send them right away This took place fulfill what spoken through prophet Say Daughter Zion See your King comes you gentle riding on donkey on colt foal donkey So disciples went did Jesus had directed them They brought donkey colt laid their cloaks on them Jesus sat on them massive crowd spread their cloaks on road while others cut branches from trees spread them on road crowds went ahead Him those followed shouting Hosanna Son David Blessed He who comes name Lord Hosanna highest When Jesus had entered Jerusalem whole city stirred asked Who this crowds replied This Jesus prophet from Nazareth Galilee Then Jesus entered temple courts drove out all who buying selling there He overturned tables money changers seats those selling doves He declared them written My house will called house prayer But you making den robbers blind lame came Him temple He healed them But chief priests scribes indignant when they saw wonders He performed children shouting temple courts Hosanna Son David Do you hear what these children saying they asked Yes Jesus answered Have you never read From mouths children infants You have ordained praise Then He left them went out city Bethany where He spent night morning Jesus returning city He hungry Seeing fig tree by road He went up but found nothing on except leaves May you never bear fruit again He said immediately tree withered When disciples saw this they marveled asked How did fig tree wither so quickly Truly I tell you Jesus replied if you have faith do not doubt not only will you do what done fig tree but even if you say this mountain lifted up thrown into sea will happen If you believe you will receive whatever you ask prayer When Jesus returned temple courts began teach chief priests elders people came up Him By what authority You doing these things they asked who gave You this authority I will also ask you one question Jesus replied if you answer Me I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things What source John baptism from heaven or from men They deliberated among themselves said If we say From heaven He will ask Why then did you not believe him But if we say From men we afraid people they all regard John prophet So they answered We do not know Jesus replied Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things But what do you think There man who had two sons He went first one said Son go work today vineyard I will not he replied But later he changed his mind went Then man went second son told him same thing I will sir he said But he did not go Which two did will his father first they answered Jesus said them Truly I tell you tax collectors prostitutes entering kingdom God before you John came you righteous way you did not believe him but tax collectors prostitutes did even after you saw this you did not repent believe him Listen another parable There landowner who planted vineyard He put wall around dug winepress built tower Then he rented out some tenants went away on journey When harvest time drew near he sent his servants tenants collect his share fruit But tenants seized his servants They beat one killed another stoned third Again he sent other servants more than first group But tenants did same them Finally he sent his son them They will respect my son he said But when tenants saw son they said one another This heir Come let us kill him take his inheritance So they seized him threw him out vineyard killed him Therefore when owner vineyard returns what will he do those tenants He will bring those wretches wretched end they replied will rent out vineyard other tenants who will give him his share fruit harvest time Jesus said them Have you never read Scriptures stone builders rejected has become cornerstone This from Lord marvelous our eyes Therefore I tell you kingdom God will taken away from you given people who will produce its fruit He who falls on this stone will broken pieces but he on whom falls will crushed When chief priests Pharisees heard His parables they knew Jesus speaking about them Although they wanted arrest Him they afraid crowds because people regarded Him prophet Once again Jesus spoke them parables kingdom heaven like king who prepared wedding banquet his son He sent his servants call those he had invited banquet but they refused come Again he sent other servants said Tell those who have been invited I have prepared my dinner My oxen fattened cattle have been killed everything ready Come wedding banquet But they paid no attention went away one his field another his business rest seized his servants mistreated them killed them king enraged he sent his troops destroy those murderers burn their city Then he said his servants wedding banquet ready but those I invited not worthy Go therefore crossroads invite banquet many you can find So servants went out into streets gathered everyone they could find both evil good wedding hall filled guests But when king came see guests he spotted man who not dressed wedding clothes Friend he asked how did you get here without wedding clothes But man speechless Then king told servants Tie him hand foot throw him into outer darkness where there will weeping gnashing teeth many called but few chosen Then Pharisees went out conspired trap Jesus His words They sent their disciples Him along Herodians Teacher they said we know You honest You teach way God accordance truth You seek favor from no one because You pay no attention external appearance So tell us what You think lawful pay taxes Caesar or not But Jesus knew their evil intent said You hypocrites why you testing Me Show Me coin used tax they brought Him denarius Whose image this He asked whose inscription Caesar they answered So Jesus told them Give Caesar what Caesar God what God when they heard this they amazed So they left Him went away same day Sadducees who say there no resurrection came Jesus questioned Him Teacher they said Moses declared if man dies without having children his brother marry widow raise up offspring him Now there seven brothers among us first one married died without having children So he left his wife his brother same thing happened second third brothers down seventh last all woman died resurrection then whose wife will she seven all them married her Jesus answered You mistaken because you do not know Scriptures or power God resurrection people will neither marry nor given marriage Instead they will like angels heaven But concerning resurrection dead have you not read what God said you I am God Abraham God Isaac God Jacob He not God dead but living When crowds heard this they astonished His teaching when Pharisees heard Jesus had silenced Sadducees they themselves gathered together One them expert law tested Him question Teacher which commandment greatest Law Jesus declared Love Lord your God all your heart all your soul all your mind This first greatest commandment second like Love your neighbor yourself All Law Prophets hang on these two commandments While Pharisees assembled Jesus questioned them What do you think about Christ Whose son He David they answered Jesus said them How then does David Spirit call Him Lord he says Lord said my Lord Sit My right hand until I put Your enemies under Your feet So if David calls Him Lord how can He David son No one able answer word from day on no one dared question Him any further Then Jesus spoke crowds His disciples scribes Pharisees sit Moses seat So practice observe everything they tell you But do not do what they do they do not practice what they preach They tie up heavy burdensome loads lay them on men shoulders but they themselves not willing lift finger move them All their deeds done men see They broaden their phylacteries lengthen their tassels They love places honor banquets chief seats synagogues greetings marketplaces title Rabbi by which they addressed But you not called Rabbi you have one Teacher you all brothers do not call anyone on earth your father you have one Father who heaven Nor you called instructors you have one Instructor Christ greatest among you shall your servant whoever exalts himself will humbled whoever humbles himself will exalted Woe you scribes Pharisees you hypocrites You shut kingdom heaven men faces You yourselves do not enter nor will you let those who wish enter Woe you scribes Pharisees you hypocrites You traverse land sea win single convert when he becomes one you make him twice much son hell you Woe you blind guides You say If anyone swears by temple means nothing but if anyone swears by gold temple he bound by his oath You blind fools Which greater gold or temple makes sacred you say If anyone swears by altar means nothing but if anyone swears by gift on he bound by his oath You blind men Which greater gift or altar makes sacred So then he who swears by altar swears by by everything on he who swears by temple swears by by One who dwells he who swears by heaven swears by God throne by One who sits on Woe you scribes Pharisees you hypocrites You pay tithes mint dill cumin But you have disregarded weightier matters law justice mercy faithfulness You should have practiced latter without neglecting former You blind guides You strain out gnat but swallow camel Woe you scribes Pharisees you hypocrites You clean outside cup dish but inside they full greed self indulgence Blind Pharisee First clean inside cup dish so outside may become clean well Woe you scribes Pharisees you hypocrites You like whitewashed tombs which look beautiful on outside but on inside full dead men bones every kind impurity same way

ones took their lamps but did not take along any extra oil But wise ones took oil flasks along their lamps When bridegroom delayed they all became drowsy fell asleep midnight cry rang out Here bridegroom Come out meet him Then all virgins woke up trimmed their lamps foolish ones said wise Give us some your oil our lamps going out No said wise ones or there may not enough both us you Instead go those who sell oil buy some yourselves But while they on their way buy bridegroom arrived Those who ready went him wedding banquet door shut Later other virgins arrived said Lord lord open door us But he replied Truly I tell you I do not know you Therefore keep watch because you do not know day or hour just like man going on journey who called his servants entrusted them his possessions one he gave five talents another two talents another one talent each according his own ability he went on his journey servant who had received five talents went once put them work gained five more Likewise one two talents gained two more But servant who had received one talent went off dug hole ground hid his master money After long time master those servants returned settle accounts them servant who

few things I will put you charge many things Enter into joy your master servant who had received two talents also came said Master you entrusted me two talents See I have gained two more His master replied Well done good faithful servant You have been faithful few things I will put you charge many things Enter into joy your master Finally servant who had received one talent came said Master I knew you hard man reaping where you have not sown gathering where you have not scattered seed So I afraid went out hid your talent ground See you have what belongs you You wicked lazy servant replied his master You knew I reap where I have not sown gather where I have not scattered seed Then you should have deposited my money bankers on my return I would have received back interest Therefore take talent from him give one who has ten talents everyone who has will given more he will have abundance But one who does not have even what he has will taken away from him throw worthless servant into outer darkness where there will weeping gnashing teeth When Son Man comes His glory all angels Him He will sit on His glorious throne All nations will gathered before Him He will separate people one from another shepherd separates sheep from goats He will place sheep on His right goats on His left Then King will say those on His right Come you who blessed by My Father inherit kingdom prepared you

time Jesus said crowd Have you come out swords clubs arrest Me you would outlaw Every day I sat teaching temple courts you did not arrest Me But this has all happened so writings prophets would fulfilled Then all disciples deserted Him fled Those who had arrested Jesus led Him away house Caiaphas high priest where scribes elders had gathered But Peter followed Him distance right up courtyard high priest he went sat down guards see outcome Now chief priests whole Sanhedrin seeking false testimony against Jesus order put Him death But they did not find any though many false witnesses came forward Finally two came forward declared This man said I am able destroy temple God rebuild three days So high priest stood up asked Him Have You no answer What these men testifying against You But Jesus remained silent Then high priest said Him I charge You under oath by living God Tell us if You Christ Son God You have said yourself Jesus answered But I say all you from now on you will see Son Man sitting right hand Power coming on clouds heaven this high priest tore his clothes declared He has blasphemed Why do we need any more witnesses Look now you have heard blasphemy What do you think

went look Him when they found Him they said Everyone looking You But Jesus answered Let us go on neighboring towns so I can preach there well why I have come So He went throughout Galilee preaching their synagogues driving out demons Then leper came Jesus begging on his knees If You willing You can make me clean Moved compassion Jesus reached out His hand touched man I am willing He said clean immediately leprosy left him man cleansed Jesus promptly sent him away stern warning See you dont tell anyone But go show yourself priest present offering Moses prescribed your cleansing testimony them But man went out openly began proclaim spread news Consequently Jesus could no longer enter town plain view but He stayed out solitary places Yet people came Him from every quarter few days later Jesus went back Capernaum when people heard He home they gathered such large numbers there no more room not even outside door Jesus spoke word them Then paralytic brought Him carried by four men Since they unable get Jesus through crowd they uncovered roof above Him made opening lowered paralytic on his mat When Jesus saw their faith He said paralytic Son your sins forgiven But some scribes sitting there thinking their hearts Why does this man speak like this He blaspheming Who can forgive sins but God alone once Jesus knew His spirit they thinking this way within themselves Why you thinking these things your hearts He asked Which easier say paralytic Your sins forgiven or say Get up pick up your mat walk But so you may know Son Man has authority on earth forgive sins He said paralytic I tell you get up pick up your mat go home immediately man got up picked up his mat walked out front them all result they all astounded glorified God saying We have never seen anything like this Once again Jesus went out beside sea All people came Him He taught them there He walking along He saw Levi son Alphaeus sitting tax booth Follow Me He told him Levi got up followed Him While Jesus dining Levi house many tax collectors sinners eating Him His disciples there many who followed Him When scribes who Pharisees saw Jesus eating these people they asked His disciples Why does He eat tax collectors sinners On hearing this Jesus told them not healthy who need doctor but sick I have not come call righteous but sinners Now John disciples Pharisees often fasting So people came Jesus asked Why dont Your disciples fast like John disciples those Pharisees Jesus replied How can guests bridegroom fast while He them long He them they cannot fast But time will come when bridegroom will taken from them then they will fast No one sews patch unshrunk cloth on old garment If he does new piece will pull away from old worse tear will result no one pours new wine into old wineskins If he does wine will burst skins both wine wineskins will ruined Instead new wine poured into new wineskins One Sabbath Jesus passing through grainfields His disciples began pick heads grain they walked along So Pharisees said Him Look why they doing what unlawful on Sabbath Jesus replied Have you never read what David did when he his companions hungry need During high priesthood Abiathar he entered house God ate consecrated bread which lawful only priests he gave some his companions well Then Jesus declared Sabbath made man not man Sabbath Therefore Son Man Lord even Sabbath Once again Jesus entered synagogue man withered hand there order accuse Jesus they watching see if He would heal on Sabbath Then Jesus said man withered hand Stand up among us He asked them Which lawful on Sabbath do good or do evil save life or destroy But they silent Jesus looked around them anger sorrow their hardness heart Then He said man Stretch out your hand So he stretched out restored this Pharisees went out began plotting Herodians how they might kill Jesus So Jesus withdrew His disciples sea accompanied by large crowd from Galilee Judea Jerusalem Idumea region beyond Jordan vicinity Tyre Sidon large crowd came Him when they heard what great things He doing Jesus asked His disciples have boat ready Him so crowd would not crush Him He had healed so many all who had diseases pressing forward touch Him when unclean spirits saw Him they fell down before Him cried out You Son God But He warned them sternly not make Him known Then Jesus went up on mountain called those He wanted they came Him He appointed twelve them whom He designated apostles accompany Him sent out preach have authority drive out demons These twelve He appointed Simon whom He named Peter James son Zebedee his brother John whom He named Boanerges meaning Sons Thunder Andrew Philip Bartholomew Matthew Thomas James son Alphaeus Thaddaeus Simon Zealot Judas Iscariot who betrayed Jesus Then Jesus went home once again crowd gathered so He His disciples could not even eat When His family heard about this they went out take custody Him saying He out His mind scribes who had come down from Jerusalem saying He possessed by Beelzebul By prince demons He drives out demons So Jesus called them together began speak them parables How can Satan drive out Satan If kingdom divided against itself cannot stand If house divided against itself cannot stand if Satan divided rises against himself he cannot stand his end has come Indeed no one can enter strong man house steal his possessions unless he first ties up strong man Then he can plunder his house Truly I tell you sons men will forgiven all sins blasphemies many they utter But whoever blasphemes against Holy Spirit will never forgiven he guilty eternal sin Jesus made this statement because they saying He has unclean spirit Then Jesus mother brothers came stood outside They sent someone summon Him crowd sitting around Him Look He told Your mother brothers outside asking You But Jesus replied Who My mother My brothers Looking those seated circle around Him He said Here My mother My brothers whoever does will God My brother sister mother Once again Jesus began teach beside sea such large crowd gathered around Him He got into boat sat while all people crowded along shore He taught them many things parables His teaching He said Listen farmer went out sow his seed he sowing some seed fell along path birds came devoured Some fell on rocky ground where did not have much soil sprang up quickly because soil shallow But when sun rose seedlings scorched they withered because they had no root Other seed fell among thorns which grew up choked seedlings they yielded no crop Still other seed fell on good soil where sprouted grew up produced crop one bearing thirtyfold another sixtyfold another hundredfold Then Jesus said He who has ears hear let him hear soon Jesus alone Twelve those around Him they asked Him about parable He replied mystery kingdom God has been given you but those on outside everything expressed parables so they may ever seeing but never perceiving ever hearing but never understanding otherwise they might turn forgiven Then Jesus said them Do you not understand this parable Then how will you understand any parables farmer sows word Some like seeds along path where word sown soon they hear Satan comes takes away word sown them Some like seeds sown on rocky ground They hear word once receive joy But they themselves have no root they remain only season When trouble or persecution comes because word they quickly fall away Others like seeds sown among thorns They hear word but worries this life deceitfulness wealth desire other things come choke word becomes unfruitful Still others like seeds sown on good soil They hear word receive produce crop thirtyfold sixtyfold or hundredfold Jesus also said them Does anyone bring lamp put under basket or under bed Doesnt he set on stand there nothing hidden will not disclosed nothing concealed will not brought light If anyone has ears hear let him hear He went on say Pay attention what you hear measure you use will measured you even more will added you whoever has will given more But whoever does not have even what he has will taken away from him Jesus also said kingdom God like man who scatters seed on ground Night day he sleeps wakes seed sprouts grows though he knows not how All by itself earth produces crop first stalk then head then grain ripens within soon grain ripe he swings sickle because harvest has come Then He asked what can we compare kingdom God what parable shall we present like mustard seed which smallest all seeds sown upon earth But after planted grows largest all garden plants puts forth great branches so birds air nest its shade many such parables Jesus spoke word them extent they could understand He did not tell them anything without using parable But privately He explained everything His own disciples When evening came He said His disciples Let us cross other side After they had dismissed crowd they took Jesus them since He already boat there other boats Him Soon violent windstorm came up waves breaking over boat so being swamped But Jesus stern sleeping on cushion So they woke Him said Teacher dont You care we perishing Then Jesus got up rebuked wind sea Silence He commanded still wind died down perfectly calm Why you so afraid He asked Do you still have no faith Overwhelmed fear they asked one another Who this even wind sea obey Him On other side sea they arrived region Gerasenes soon Jesus got out boat He met by man unclean spirit who coming from tombs This man had been living tombs could no longer restrained even chains Though he often bound chains shackles he had broken chains shattered shackles Now there no one strength subdue him Night day tombs mountains he kept crying out cutting himself stones When man saw Jesus from distance he ran fell on his knees before Him he shouted loud voice What do You want me Jesus Son Most High God I beg You before God not torture me Jesus had already declared Come out this man you unclean spirit What your name Jesus asked My name Legion he replied we many he begged Jesus repeatedly not send them out region There on nearby hillside large herd pigs feeding So demons begged Jesus Send us pigs so we may enter them He gave them permission unclean spirits came out went into pigs herd about two thousand rushed down steep bank into sea drowned water Those tending pigs ran off reported this town countryside people went out see what had happened When they came Jesus they saw man who had been possessed by legion demons sitting there clothed his right mind they afraid Those who had seen described what had happened demon possessed man also pigs people began beg Jesus leave their region He getting into boat man who had been possessed by demons begged go Him But Jesus would not allow him Go home your own people He said tell them how much Lord has done you what mercy He has shown you So man went away began proclaim throughout Decapolis how much Jesus had done him everyone amazed When Jesus had again crossed by boat other side large crowd gathered around Him beside sea synagogue leader named Jairus arrived seeing Jesus he fell His feet pleaded Him urgently My little daughter near death Please come place Your hands on her so she will healed live So Jesus went him large crowd followed pressed around Him woman there who had suffered from bleeding twelve years She had borne much agony under care many physicians had spent all she had but no avail Instead her condition had only grown worse When woman heard about Jesus she came up through crowd behind Him touched His cloak she kept saying If only I touch His garments I will healed Immediately her bleeding stopped she sensed her body she healed her affliction once Jesus aware power had gone out from Him Turning crowd He asked Who touched My garments His disciples answered You can see crowd pressing on You yet You ask Who touched Me But He kept looking around see who had done this Then woman knowing what had happened her came fell down before Him trembling fear she told Him whole truth Daughter said Jesus your faith has healed you Go peace free your affliction While He still speaking messengers from house Jairus arrived said Your daughter dead why bother Teacher anymore But Jesus overheard their conversation said Jairus Do not afraid just believe He did not allow anyone accompany Him except Peter James John brother James When they arrived house synagogue leader Jesus saw commotion people weeping wailing loudly He went inside asked Why all this commotion weeping child not dead but asleep they laughed Him After He had put them all outside He took child father mother His own companions went see child Taking her by hand Jesus said Talitha koum which means Little girl I say you get up Immediately girl got up began walk around She twelve years old once they utterly astounded Then Jesus gave strict orders no one should know about this He told them give her something eat Jesus went on from there came His hometown accompanied by His disciples When Sabbath came He began teach synagogue many who heard Him astonished Where did this man get these ideas they asked What this wisdom He has been given how can He perform such miracles Isnt this carpenter son Mary brother James Joses Judas Simon Arent His sisters here us well they took offense Him Then Jesus said them Only his hometown among his relatives his own household prophet without honor So He could not perform any miracles there except lay His hands on few sick heal them He amazed their unbelief He went around from village village teaching people Then Jesus called Twelve Him began send them out two by two giving them authority over unclean spirits He instructed them take nothing but staff journey no bread no bag no money their belts wear sandals but not second tunic He told them When you enter house stay there until you leave area If anyone will not welcome you or listen you shake dust off your feet when you leave place testimony against them So they set out preached people should repent They also drove out many demons healed many sick anointing them oil Now King Herod heard about this Jesus name had become well known people saying John Baptist has risen from dead why miraculous powers work him Others saying He Elijah still others He prophet like one prophets old But when Herod heard this he said John whom I beheaded has risen from dead Herod himself had ordered John arrested bound imprisoned on account his brother Philip wife Herodias whom Herod had married John had been telling Herod not lawful you have your brother

yet he listened him gladly On Herod birthday her opportunity arose Herod held banquet his nobles military commanders leading men Galilee When daughter Herodias came danced she pleased Herod his guests king said girl Ask me whatever you wish I will give you he swore her Whatever you ask me I will give you up half my kingdom Then she went out asked her mother What should I request her mother answered

So without delay king commanded John head brought He sent executioner who went beheaded him prison man brought John head on platter presented girl who gave her mother When John disciples heard about this they came took his body placed tomb Meanwhile apostles gathered around Jesus brought Him news all they had done taught He said them Come Me privately solitary place let us rest while many people coming going they did not even have time eat So they went away boat by themselves solitary place But many people saw them leaving recognized them They ran together on foot from all towns arrived before them When Jesus stepped ashore saw large crowd He had compassion on them because they like sheep without shepherd He began teach them many things By now hour already late So disciples came Jesus said This desolate place hour already late Dismiss crowd so they can go surrounding countryside villages buy themselves something eat But Jesus told them You give them something eat They asked

all saw Him terrified But Jesus spoke up once Take courage I Do not afraid Then He climbed into boat them wind died down disciples utterly astounded they had not understood about loaves but their hearts had been hardened When they had crossed over they landed Gennesaret moored boat soon they got out boat people recognized Jesus ran through whole region carrying sick on mats wherever they heard He wherever He went villages towns countrysides they laid sick marketplaces begged Him just let them touch fringe His cloak all who touched Him healed Then Pharisees some scribes who had come from Jerusalem gathered around Jesus they saw some His disciples eating hands defiled unwashed Now holding tradition elders Pharisees all Jews do not eat until they wash their hands ceremonially on returning from market they do not eat unless they wash there many other traditions them observe including washing cups pitchers kettles couches dining So Pharisees scribes questioned Jesus Why do Your disciples not walk according tradition elders Instead they eat defiled hands Jesus answered them Isaiah prophesied correctly about you hypocrites written These people honor Me their lips but their hearts far from Me They worship Me vain they teach doctrine precepts men You have disregarded commandment God keep tradition men He went on say You neatly set aside command God maintain your own tradition Moses said Honor your father your mother Anyone who curses his father or mother must put death But you say if man says his father or mother Whatever you would have received from me Corban gift devoted God he no longer permitted do anything his father or mother Thus you nullify word God by tradition you have handed down you do so many such matters Once again Jesus called crowd Him said All you listen Me understand Nothing enters man from outside can defile him but things come out man these what defile him After Jesus had left crowd gone into house His disciples inquired about parable you still so dull He asked Do you not understand Nothing enters man from outside can defile him because does not enter his heart but goes into stomach then eliminated Thus all foods clean He continued What comes out man what defiles him from within hearts men come evil thoughts sexual immorality theft murder adultery greed wickedness deceit debauchery envy slander arrogance foolishness All these evils come from within these what defile man Jesus left place went region Tyre Not wanting anyone know He there He entered house but unable escape their notice Instead woman whose little daughter had unclean spirit soon heard about Jesus she came fell His feet Now she Greek woman Syrophoenician origin she kept asking Jesus drive demon out her daughter First let children have their fill He said not right take children bread toss dogs Yes Lord she replied even dogs under table eat children crumbs Then Jesus told her Because this answer you may go demon has left your daughter she went home found her child lying on bed demon gone Then Jesus left region Tyre went through Sidon Sea Galilee into region Decapolis Some people brought Him man who deaf hardly able speak they begged Jesus place His hand on him So Jesus took him aside privately away from crowd put His fingers into man ears Then He spit touched man tongue looking up heaven He sighed deeply said him Ephphatha which means opened Immediately man ears opened his tongue released he began speak plainly Jesus ordered them not tell anyone But more He ordered them more widely they proclaimed people utterly astonished said He has done all things well He makes even deaf hear mute speak those days crowd once again became very large they had nothing eat Jesus called disciples Him said I have compassion this crowd because they have already been Me three days have nothing eat If I send them home hungry they will faint along way some them have come great distance His disciples replied Where this desolate place could anyone find enough bread feed all these people How many loaves do you have Jesus asked Seven they replied He instructed crowd sit down on ground Then He took seven loaves gave thanks broke them gave them His disciples set before people they distributed them crowd They also had few small fish Jesus blessed them ordered these set before them well people ate satisfied disciples picked up seven basketfuls broken pieces left over about four thousand men present soon Jesus had dismissed crowd He got into boat His disciples went district Dalmanutha Then Pharisees came began argue Jesus testing Him by demanding from Him sign from heaven Jesus sighed deeply His spirit said Why does this generation demand sign Truly I tell you no sign will given this generation He left them got back into boat crossed other side Now disciples had forgotten take bread except one loaf they had them boat Watch out He cautioned them Beware leaven Pharisees Herod So they began discuss one another fact they had no bread Aware their conversation Jesus asked them Why you debating about having no bread Do you still not see or understand Do you have such hard hearts Having eyes do you not see having ears do you not hear do you not remember When I broke five loaves five thousand how many basketfuls broken pieces did you collect Twelve they answered when I broke seven loaves four thousand how many basketfuls broken pieces did you collect Seven they said Then He asked them Do you still not understand When they arrived Bethsaida some people brought blind man begged Jesus touch him So He took blind man by hand led him out village Then He spit on man eyes placed His hands on him Can you see anything He asked man looked up said I can see people but they look like trees walking around Once again Jesus placed His hands on man eyes when he opened them his sight restored he could see everything clearly Jesus sent him home said Do not go back into village Then Jesus His disciples went on villages around Caesarea Philippi On way He questioned His disciples Who do people say I am They replied Some say John Baptist others say Elijah still others one prophets But what about you Jesus asked Who do you say I am Peter answered You Christ Jesus warned them not tell anyone about Him Then He began teach them Son Man must suffer many things rejected by elders chief priests scribes He must killed after three days rise again He spoke this message quite frankly Peter took Him aside began rebuke Him But Jesus turning looking His disciples rebuked Peter said Get behind Me Satan you do not have mind things God but things men Then Jesus called crowd Him along His disciples He told them If anyone wants come after Me he must deny himself take up his cross follow Me whoever wants save his life will lose but whoever loses his life My sake gospel will save What does profit man gain whole world yet forfeit his soul Or what can man give exchange his soul If anyone ashamed Me My words this adulterous sinful generation Son Man will also ashamed him when He comes His Father glory holy angels Then Jesus said them Truly I tell you there some standing here who will not taste death before they see kingdom God arrive power After six days Jesus took Him Peter James John led them up high mountain by themselves There He transfigured before them His clothes became radiantly white brighter than any launderer on earth could bleach them Elijah Moses appeared before them talking Jesus Peter said Jesus Rabbi good us here Let us put up three shelters one You one Moses one Elijah they all so terrified Peter did not know what else say Then cloud appeared enveloped them voice came from cloud This My beloved Son Listen Him Suddenly when they looked around they saw no one them except Jesus they coming down mountain Jesus admonished them not tell anyone what they had seen until Son Man had risen from dead So they kept this matter themselves discussing what meant rise from dead they asked Jesus Why do scribes say Elijah must come first He replied Elijah does indeed come first he restores all things Why then written Son Man must suffer many things rejected But I tell you Elijah has indeed come they have done him whatever they wished just written about him When they returned other disciples they saw large crowd around them scribes arguing them soon all people saw Jesus they filled awe ran greet Him What you disputing them He asked Someone crowd replied Teacher I brought You my son who has spirit makes him mute Whenever seizes him throws him ground He foams mouth gnashes his teeth becomes rigid I asked Your disciples drive out but they unable O unbelieving generation Jesus replied How long must I remain you How long must I put up you Bring boy Me So they brought him seeing Jesus spirit immediately threw boy into convulsion He fell ground rolled around foaming mouth Jesus asked boy father How long has this been him From childhood he said often throws him into fire or into water trying kill him But if You can do anything have compassion on us help us If You can echoed Jesus All things possible him who believes Immediately boy father cried out I do believe help my unbelief When Jesus saw crowd had come running He rebuked unclean spirit You deaf mute spirit He said I command you come out never enter him again After shrieking convulsing him violently spirit came out boy became like corpse so many said He dead But Jesus took him by hand helped him his feet he stood up After Jesus had gone into house His disciples asked Him privately Why couldnt we drive out Jesus answered This kind cannot come out except by prayer Going on from there they passed through Galilee But Jesus did not want anyone know because He teaching His disciples He told them Son Man will delivered into hands men They will kill Him after three days He will rise But they did not understand this statement they afraid ask Him about Then they came Capernaum While Jesus house He asked them What you discussing on way But they silent on way they had been arguing about which them greatest Sitting down Jesus called Twelve said If anyone wants first he must last all servant all Then He had little child stand among them Taking child His arms He said them Whoever welcomes one these little children My name welcomes Me whoever welcomes Me welcomes not only Me but One who sent Me John said Him Teacher we saw someone else driving out demons Your name we tried stop him because he does not accompany us Do not stop him Jesus replied no one who performs miracle My name can turn around speak evil Me whoever not against us us Indeed if anyone gives you even cup water because you bear name Christ truly I tell you he will never lose his reward But if anyone causes one these little ones who believe Me stumble would better him have large millstone hung around his neck thrown into sea If your hand causes you sin cut off better you enter life crippled than have two hands go into hell into unquenchable fire If your foot causes you sin cut off better you enter life lame than have two feet thrown into hell if your eye causes you sin pluck out better you enter kingdom God one eye than have two eyes thrown into hell where their worm never dies fire never quenched everyone will salted fire Salt good but if salt loses its saltiness what will you season Have salt among yourselves peace one another Then Jesus left place went into region Judea beyond Jordan Again crowds came Him He taught them His custom Some Pharisees came test Him lawful man divorce his wife they inquired What did Moses command you He replied They answered Moses permitted man write his wife certificate divorce send her away But Jesus told them Moses wrote this commandment you because your hardness heart However from beginning creation God made them male female this reason man will leave his father mother united his wife two will become one flesh So they no longer two but one flesh Therefore what God has joined together let man not separate When they back inside house disciples asked Jesus about this matter So He told them Whoever divorces his wife marries another woman commits adultery against her if woman divorces her husband marries another man she commits adultery Now people bringing little children Jesus Him place His hands on them disciples rebuked those who brought them But when Jesus saw this He indignant told them Let little children come Me do not hinder them kingdom God belongs such these Truly I tell you anyone who does not receive kingdom God like little child will never enter He took children His arms placed His hands on them blessed them Jesus started on His way man ran up knelt before Him Good Teacher he asked what must I do inherit eternal life Why do you call Me good Jesus replied No one good except God alone You know commandments Do not murder do not commit adultery do not steal do not bear false witness do not cheat others honor your father mother Teacher he replied all these I have kept from my youth Jesus looked him loved him said him There one thing you lack Go sell everything you own give poor you will have treasure heaven Then come follow Me But man saddened by these words went away sorrow because he had great wealth Then Jesus looked around said His disciples How hard rich enter kingdom God disciples amazed His words But Jesus said them again Children how hard enter kingdom God easier camel pass through eye needle than rich man enter kingdom God They even more astonished said one another Who then can saved Jesus looked them said man this impossible but not God all things possible God Peter began say Him Look we have left everything followed You Truly I tell you Jesus replied no one who has left home or brothers or sisters or mother or

courts began drive out those who buying selling there He overturned tables money changers seats those selling doves He would not allow anyone carry merchandise through temple courts Then Jesus began teach them He declared not written My house will called house prayer all nations But you have made den robbers When chief priests scribes heard this they looked way kill Him they afraid Him because whole crowd astonished His teaching when evening came Jesus His disciples went out city they walking back morning they saw fig tree withered from its roots Peter remembered said Look Rabbi fig tree You cursed has withered Have faith God Jesus said them Truly I tell you if anyone says this mountain lifted up thrown into sea has no doubt his heart but believes will happen will done him Therefore I tell you whatever you ask prayer believe you have received will yours when you stand pray if you hold anything against another forgive so your Father heaven will forgive your trespasses well After their return Jerusalem Jesus walking temple courts chief priests scribes elders came up Him By what authority You doing these things they asked who gave You authority do them I will ask you one question Jesus replied if you answer Me I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things John baptism from heaven or from men Answer Me They deliberated among themselves what they should answer If we say From heaven He will ask Why then did you not believe him But if we say From men they afraid people they all held John truly prophet So they answered We do not know Jesus replied Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things Then Jesus began speak them parables man planted vineyard He put wall around dug wine vat built watchtower Then he rented out some tenants went away on journey harvest time he sent servant tenants collect his share fruit vineyard But they seized servant beat him sent him away empty handed Then he sent them another servant they struck him over head treated him shamefully He sent still another this one they killed He sent many others some they beat others they killed Finally having one beloved son he sent him them They will respect my son he said But tenants said one another This heir Come let us kill him inheritance will ours So they seized son killed him threw him out vineyard What then will owner vineyard do He will come kill those tenants will give vineyard others Have you never read this Scripture stone builders rejected has become cornerstone This from Lord marvelous our eyes this leaders sought arrest Jesus they knew He had spoken this parable against them But fearing crowd they left Him went away Later they sent some Pharisees Herodians catch Jesus His words Teacher they said we know You honest seek favor from no one Indeed You impartial teach way God accordance truth lawful pay taxes Caesar or not Should we pay them or not But Jesus saw through their hypocrisy said Why you testing Me Bring Me denarius inspect So they brought He asked them Whose image this whose inscription Caesar they answered Then Jesus told them Give Caesar what Caesar God what God they marveled Him Then Sadducees who say there no resurrection came Jesus questioned Him Teacher Moses wrote us if man brother dies leaves wife but no children man marry his brother widow raise up offspring him Now there seven brothers first one married died leaving no children Then second one married widow but he also died left no children third did likewise this way none seven left any children last all woman died resurrection then whose wife will she all seven married her Jesus said them Arent you mistaken because you do not know Scriptures or power God When dead rise they will neither marry nor given marriage Instead they will like angels heaven But concerning dead rising have you not read about burning bush Book Moses how God told him I am God Abraham God Isaac God Jacob He not God dead but living You badly mistaken Now one scribes had come up heard their debate Noticing how well Jesus had answered them he asked Him Which commandment most important all Jesus replied This most important Hear O Israel Lord our God Lord One Love Lord your God all your heart all your soul all your mind all your strength second this Love your neighbor yourself No other commandment greater than these Right Teacher scribe replied You have stated correctly God One there no other but Him love Him all your heart all your understanding all your strength love your neighbor yourself which more important than all burnt offerings sacrifices When Jesus saw man had answered wisely He said You not far from kingdom God no one dared question Him any further While Jesus teaching temple courts He asked How can scribes say Christ Son David Speaking by Holy Spirit David himself declared Lord said my Lord Sit My right hand until I put Your enemies under Your feet David himself calls Him Lord So how can He David son large crowd listened Him delight His teaching Jesus also said Watch out scribes They like walk around long robes receive greetings marketplaces have chief seats synagogues places honor banquets They defraud widows their houses show make lengthy prayers These men will receive greater condemnation Jesus sitting opposite treasury He watched crowd putting money into many rich people put large amounts Then one poor widow came put two small copper coins which amounted small fraction denarius Jesus called His disciples Him said Truly I tell you this poor widow has put more than all others into treasury they all contributed out their surplus but she out her poverty has put all she had live on Jesus leaving temple one His disciples said Him Teacher look magnificent stones buildings Do you see all these great buildings Jesus replied Not one stone here will left on another every one will thrown down While Jesus sitting on Mount Olives opposite temple Peter James John Andrew asked Him privately

your own eye You hypocrite First take beam out your own eye then you will see clearly remove speck from your brother eye No good tree bears bad fruit nor does bad tree bear good fruit each tree known by its own fruit Indeed figs not gathered from thornbushes nor grapes from brambles good man brings good things out good treasure his heart evil man brings evil things out evil treasure his heart out overflow heart mouth speaks Why do you call Me Lord Lord but not do what I say I will show you what he like who comes Me hears My words acts on them He like man building house who dug down deep laid his foundation on rock When flood came torrent crashed against house but could not shake because well built But one who hears My words does not act on them like man who built his house on ground without foundation torrent crashed against house immediately fell great its destruction When Jesus had concluded His discourse hearing people He went Capernaum There highly valued servant centurion

When Jesus heard this He marveled centurion Turning crowd following Him He said I tell you not even Israel have I found such great faith when messengers returned house they found servant good health Soon afterward Jesus went town called Nain His disciples went Him accompanied by large crowd He approached town gate He saw dead man being carried out only son his mother she widow large crowd from town her When Lord saw her He had compassion on her said Do not weep Then He went up touched coffin those carrying stood still Young man He said I tell you get up dead man sat up began speak Then Jesus gave him back his mother sense awe swept over all them they glorified God great prophet has appeared among us they said God has visited His people news about Jesus spread throughout Judea all surrounding region Then John disciples informed him about all these things So John called two his disciples sent them ask Lord You One who come or should we look someone else When men came Jesus they said John Baptist sent us ask You One who come or should we look someone else very hour Jesus healed many people their diseases afflictions evil spirits He gave sight many who blind So He replied Go back report John what you have seen heard blind receive sight lame walk lepers cleansed deaf hear dead raised good news preached poor Blessed one who does not fall away on account Me After John messengers had left Jesus began speak crowds about John What did you go out into wilderness see reed swaying wind Otherwise what did you go out see man dressed fine clothes Look those who wear elegant clothing live luxury found palaces What then did you go out see prophet Yes I tell you more than prophet This one about whom written Behold I will send My messenger ahead You who will prepare Your way before You I tell you among those born women there no one greater than John yet even least kingdom God greater than he All people who heard this even tax collectors acknowledged God justice they had received baptism John But Pharisees experts law rejected God purpose themselves because they had not been baptized by John what then can I compare men this generation What they like They like children sitting marketplace calling out one another We played flute you you did not dance we sang dirge you did not weep John Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine you say He has demon Son Man came eating drinking you say Look this glutton drunkard friend tax collectors sinners But wisdom vindicated by all her children Then one Pharisees invited Jesus eat him He entered Pharisee house reclined table When sinful woman from town learned Jesus dining there she brought alabaster jar perfume she stood behind Him His feet weeping she began wet His feet her tears wipe them her hair Then she kissed His feet anointed them perfume When Pharisee who had invited Jesus saw this he said himself If this man prophet He would know who this what kind woman touching Him she sinner But Jesus answered him Simon I have something tell you Tell me Teacher he said Two men debtors certain moneylender One owed him five hundred denarii other fifty When they unable repay him he forgave both them Which one then will love him more I suppose one who forgiven more Simon replied You have judged correctly Jesus said turning toward woman He said Simon Do you see this woman When I entered your house you did not give Me water My feet but she wet My feet her tears wiped them her hair You did not greet Me kiss but she has not stopped kissing My feet since I arrived You did not anoint My head oil but she has anointed My feet perfume Therefore I tell you because her many sins have been forgiven she has loved much But he who has been forgiven little loves little Then Jesus said her Your sins forgiven But those table began say themselves Who this who even forgives sins Jesus told woman Your faith has saved you go peace Soon afterward Jesus traveled from one town village another preaching proclaiming good news kingdom God Twelve Him well some women who had been healed evil spirits infirmities Mary called Magdalene from whom seven demons had gone out Joanna wife Herod household manager Chuza Susanna many others These women ministering them out their own means While large crowd gathering people coming Jesus from town after town He told them this parable farmer went out sow his seed he sowing some seed fell along path where trampled birds air devoured Some fell on rocky ground when came up seedlings withered because they had no moisture Other seed fell among thorns which grew up choked seedlings Still other seed fell on good soil where sprang up produced crop hundredfold Jesus said this He called out He who has ears hear let him hear Then His disciples asked Him what this parable meant He replied knowledge mysteries kingdom God has been given you but others I speak parables so though seeing they may not see though hearing they may not understand Now this meaning parable seed word God seeds along path those who hear but devil comes takes away word from their hearts so they may not believe saved seeds on rocky ground those who hear word receive joy but they have no root They believe season but time testing they fall away seeds fell among thorns those who hear but they go on their way they choked by worries riches pleasures this life their fruit does not mature But seeds on good soil those noble good heart who hear word cling by persevering produce crop No one lights lamp covers jar or puts under bed Instead he sets on stand so those who enter can see light there nothing hidden will not disclosed nothing concealed will not made known brought light Pay attention therefore how you listen Whoever has will given more but whoever does not have even what he thinks he has will taken away from him Then Jesus mother brothers came see Him but they unable reach Him because crowd He told Your mother brothers standing outside wanting see You But He replied My mother brothers those who hear word God carry out One day Jesus said His disciples Let us cross other side lake So He got into boat them set out they sailed He fell asleep windstorm came down on lake so boat being swamped they great danger disciples went woke Him saying Master Master we perishing Then Jesus got up rebuked wind raging waters they subsided all calm Where your faith He asked Frightened amazed they asked one another Who this He commands even winds water they obey Him Then they sailed region Gerasenes across lake from Galilee When Jesus stepped ashore He met by demon possessed man from town long time this man had not worn clothing or lived house but he stayed tombs When man saw Jesus he cried out fell down before Him shouting loud voice What do You want me Jesus Son Most High God I beg You not torture me Jesus had commanded unclean spirit come out man Many times had seized him though he bound chains shackles he had broken chains been driven by demon into solitary places What your name Jesus asked Legion he replied because many demons had gone into him demons kept begging Jesus not order them go into Abyss There on hillside large herd pigs feeding So demons begged Jesus let them enter pigs He gave them permission Then demons came out man went into pigs herd rushed down steep bank into lake drowned When those tending pigs saw what had happened they ran off reported this town countryside So people went out see what had happened They came Jesus found man whom demons had left sitting Jesus feet clothed his right mind they afraid Meanwhile those who had seen reported how demon possessed man had been healed Then all people region Gerasenes asked Jesus depart from them because great fear had taken hold them So He got into boat started back man whom demons had left begged go Jesus But He sent him away saying Return home describe how much God has done you So man went away proclaimed all over town how much Jesus had done him When Jesus returned crowd welcomed Him they had all been waiting Him Just then synagogue leader named Jairus came fell Jesus feet He begged Him come his house because his only daughter who about twelve dying Jesus went him crowds pressed around Him including woman who had suffered from bleeding twelve years She had spent all her money on physicians but no one able heal her She came up behind Jesus touched fringe His cloak immediately her bleeding stopped Who touched Me Jesus asked But they all denied Master said Peter people crowding pressing against You But Jesus declared Someone touched Me I know power has gone out from Me Then woman seeing she could not escape notice came trembling fell down before Him presence all people she explained why she had touched Him how she had immediately been healed Daughter said Jesus your faith has healed you Go peace While He still speaking someone arrived from house synagogue leader Your daughter dead he told Jairus Do not bother Teacher anymore But Jesus overheard them said Jairus Do not afraid just believe she will healed When He entered house He did not allow anyone go Him except Peter John James child father mother Meanwhile everyone weeping mourning her But Jesus said Stop weeping she not dead but asleep they laughed Him knowing she dead But Jesus took her by hand called out Child get up Her spirit returned once she got up He directed she given something eat Her parents astounded but Jesus ordered them not tell anyone what had happened Then Jesus called Twelve together gave them power authority over all demons power cure diseases He sent them out proclaim kingdom God heal sick Take nothing journey He told them no staff no bag no bread no money no second tunic Whatever house you enter stay there until you leave area If anyone does not welcome you shake dust off your feet when you leave town testimony against them So they set out went from village village preaching gospel healing people everywhere When Herod tetrarch heard about all happening he perplexed some saying John had risen from dead others Elijah had appeared still others prophet old had arisen I beheaded John Herod said but who this man I hear such things about he kept trying see Jesus Then apostles returned reported Jesus all they had done Taking them away privately He withdrew town called Bethsaida But crowds found out followed Him He welcomed them spoke them about kingdom God He healed those who needed healing day neared its end Twelve came Jesus said Dismiss crowd so they can go surrounding villages countryside lodging provisions we desolate place here But Jesus told them You give them something eat We have only five loaves bread two fish they answered unless we go buy food all these people There about five thousand men He told His disciples Have them sit down groups about fifty each They did so everyone seated Taking five loaves two fish looking up heaven Jesus spoke blessing broke them Then He gave them disciples set before people They all ate satisfied disciples picked up twelve basketfuls broken pieces left over One day Jesus praying private disciples Him He questioned them Who do crowds say I am They replied Some say John Baptist others say Elijah still others prophet old has arisen But what about you Jesus asked Who do you say I am Peter answered Christ God Jesus strictly warned them not tell this anyone Son Man must suffer many things He said He must rejected by elders chief priests scribes He must killed on third day raised life Then Jesus said all them If anyone wants come after Me he must deny himself take up his cross daily follow Me whoever wants save his life will lose but whoever loses his life My sake will save What does profit man gain whole world yet lose or forfeit his very self If anyone ashamed Me My words Son Man will ashamed him when He comes His glory glory Father holy angels But I tell you truthfully some who standing here will not taste death before they see kingdom God About eight days after Jesus had said these things He took Him Peter John James went up on mountain pray He praying appearance His face changed His clothes became radiantly white Suddenly two men Moses Elijah began talking Jesus They appeared glory spoke about His departure which He about accomplish Jerusalem Meanwhile Peter his companions overcome by sleep but when they awoke they saw Jesus glory two men standing Him Moses Elijah leaving Peter said Jesus Master good us here Let us put up three shelters one You one Moses one Elijah He did not know what he saying While Peter speaking cloud appeared enveloped them they afraid they entered cloud voice came from cloud saying This My Son whom I have chosen Listen Him After voice had spoken only Jesus present them disciples kept this themselves those days they did not tell anyone what they had seen next day when they came down from mountain Jesus met by large crowd Suddenly man crowd cried out Teacher I beg You look my son he my only child spirit keeps seizing him he screams abruptly throws him into convulsions so he foams mouth keeps mauling him rarely departs from him I begged Your disciples drive out but they unable O unbelieving perverse generation Jesus replied How long must I remain you put up you Bring your son here Even while boy approaching demon slammed him ground convulsion But Jesus rebuked unclean spirit healed boy gave him back his father they all astonished greatness God While everyone marveling all Jesus doing He said His disciples Let these words sink into your ears Son Man about delivered into hands men But they did not understand this statement veiled from them so they could not comprehend they afraid ask Him about Then argument started among disciples which them would greatest But Jesus knowing thoughts their hearts had little child stand beside Him He said them Whoever welcomes this little child My name welcomes Me whoever welcomes Me welcomes One who sent Me whoever least among all you he greatest Master said John we saw someone driving out demons Your name we tried stop him because he does not accompany us Do not stop him Jesus replied whoever not against you you day His ascension approached Jesus resolutely set out Jerusalem He sent messengers on ahead who went into village Samaritans make arrangements Him But people there refused welcome Him because He heading Jerusalem When disciples James John saw this they asked Lord do You want us call down fire from heaven consume them But Jesus turned rebuked them He His disciples went on another village they walking along road someone said Jesus I will follow You wherever You go Jesus replied Foxes have dens birds air have nests but Son Man has no place lay His head Then He said another man Follow Me man replied Lord first let me go bury my father But Jesus told him Let dead bury their own dead You however go proclaim kingdom God Still another said I will follow You Lord but first let me bid farewell my family Then Jesus declared No one who puts his hand plow then looks back fit kingdom God After this Lord appointed seventy two others sent them two by two ahead Him every town place He about visit He told them harvest plentiful but workers few Ask Lord harvest therefore send out workers into His harvest Go I am sending you out like lambs among wolves Carry no purse or bag or sandals Do not greet anyone along road Whatever house

move around from house house If you enter town they welcome you eat whatever set before you Heal sick who there tell them kingdom God near you But if you enter town they do not welcome you go into streets declare Even dust your town clings our feet we wipe off testimony against you Yet sure this kingdom God near I tell you will more bearable on day Sodom than town Woe you Chorazin Woe you Bethsaida if miracles performed you had been performed Tyre Sidon they would have repented long ago sitting sackcloth ashes But will more bearable Tyre Sidon judgment than you you Capernaum will you lifted up heaven No you will brought down Hades Whoever listens you listens Me whoever rejects you rejects Me whoever rejects Me rejects One who sent Me seventy two returned joy said Lord even demons submit us Your name So He told them I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven Behold I have given you authority tread on snakes scorpions over all power enemy Nothing will harm you Nevertheless do not rejoice spirits submit you but rejoice your names written heaven time Jesus rejoiced Holy Spirit declared I praise You Father Lord heaven earth because You have hidden these things from wise learned revealed them little children Yes Father this well pleasing Your sight All things have been entrusted Me by My Father No one knows who Son except Father no one knows who Father except Son those whom Son chooses reveal Him Then Jesus turned disciples said privately Blessed eyes see what you see I tell you many prophets kings desired see what you see but did not see hear what you hear but did not hear One day expert law stood up test Him Teacher he asked what must I do inherit eternal life What written Law Jesus replied How do you read He answered Love Lord your God all your heart all your soul all your strength all your mind Love your neighbor yourself You have answered correctly Jesus said Do this you will live But wanting justify himself he asked Jesus who my neighbor Jesus took up this question said man going down from Jerusalem Jericho when he fell into hands robbers They stripped him beat him went away leaving him half dead Now by chance priest going down same road but when he saw him he passed by on other side So too when Levite came spot saw him he passed by on other side But when Samaritan on journey came upon him he looked him had compassion He went him bandaged his wounds pouring on oil wine Then he put him on his own animal brought him inn took care him next day he took out two denarii gave them innkeeper Take care him he said on my return I will repay you any additional expense Which these three do you think neighbor man who fell into hands robbers one who showed him mercy replied expert law Then Jesus told him Go do likewise they traveled along Jesus entered village where woman named Martha welcomed Him into her home She had sister named Mary who sat Lord feet listening His message But Martha distracted by all preparations made She came Jesus said Lord do You not care my sister has left me serve alone Tell her help me Martha Martha Lord replied you worried upset about many things But only one thing necessary Mary has chosen good portion will not taken away from her One day place where Jesus had just finished praying one His disciples requested Lord teach us pray just John taught his disciples So Jesus told them When you pray say Father hallowed Your name Your kingdom come Give us each day our daily bread forgive us our sins we also forgive everyone who sins against us lead us not into temptation Then Jesus said them Suppose one you goes his friend midnight says Friend lend me three loaves bread because friend mine has come me on journey I have nothing set before him suppose one inside answers Do not bother me My door already shut my children I bed I cannot get up give you anything I tell you even though he will not get up provide him because his friendship yet because man persistence he will get up give him much he needs So I tell you Ask will given you seek you will find knock door will opened you everyone who asks receives he who seeks finds him who knocks door will opened What father among you if his son asks fish will give him snake instead Or if he asks egg will give him scorpion So if you who evil know how give good gifts your children how much more will your Father heaven give Holy Spirit those who ask Him One day Jesus driving out demon mute when demon gone man who had been mute spoke crowds amazed but some them said by Beelzebul prince demons He drives out demons others tested Him by demanding sign from heaven Knowing their thoughts Jesus said them Every kingdom divided against itself will laid waste house divided against house will fall If Satan divided against himself how can his kingdom stand After all you say I drive out demons by Beelzebul if I drive out demons by Beelzebul by whom do your sons drive them out So then they will your judges But if I drive out demons by finger God then kingdom God has come upon you When strong man fully armed guards his house his possessions secure But when someone stronger attacks overpowers him he takes away armor which man trusted then he divides up his plunder He who not Me against Me he who does not gather Me scatters When unclean spirit comes out man passes through arid places seeking rest does not find Then says I will return house I left On its return finds house swept clean put order Then goes brings seven other spirits more wicked than itself they go dwell there final plight man worse than first Jesus saying these things woman crowd raised her voice said Blessed womb bore You blessed breasts nursed You But He replied Blessed rather those who hear word God obey crowds increasing Jesus said This wicked

Zechariah who killed between altar sanctuary Yes I tell you all will charged this generation Woe you experts law you have taken away key knowledge You yourselves have not entered you have hindered those who entering Jesus went on from there scribes Pharisees began oppose Him bitterly ply Him questions about many things waiting catch Him something He might say meantime crowd many thousands had gathered so they trampling one another Jesus began speak first His disciples Beware leaven Pharisees which hypocrisy There nothing concealed will not disclosed nothing hidden will not made known What

life will required you Then who will own what you have accumulated This how will anyone who stores up treasure himself but not rich toward God Then Jesus said His disciples Therefore I tell you do not worry about your life what you will eat or about your body what you will wear life more than food body more than clothes Consider ravens They do not sow or reap they have no storehouse or barn yet God feeds them How much more valuable you than birds Who you by worrying can add single hour his life So if you cannot do such small thing why do you worry about rest Consider how lilies grow They do not labor or spin Yet I tell you not even Solomon all his glory adorned like one these If how God clothes grass field which here today tomorrow thrown into furnace how much more will He clothe you O you

One Sabbath Jesus teaching one synagogues woman there had been disabled by spirit eighteen years She hunched over could not stand up straight When Jesus saw her He called her over said Woman you set

So come healed on those days not on Sabbath You hypocrites Lord replied Does not each you on Sabbath untie his ox or donkey from stall lead water Then should not this daughter Abraham whom Satan has kept bound eighteen long years released from her bondage on Sabbath day When Jesus said this all His adversaries humiliated whole crowd rejoiced all glorious things He doing Then Jesus asked What kingdom God like what can I compare like mustard seed man tossed into his garden grew became tree birds air nested its branches Again He asked what can I compare kingdom God like leaven woman took mixed into three measures flour until all leavened Then Jesus traveled throughout towns villages teaching He made His way toward Jerusalem Lord someone asked Him will only few people saved Jesus

honor case someone more distinguished than you has been invited Then host who invited both you will come tell you Give this man your seat humiliation you will have take last place But when you invited go sit last place so your host will come tell you Friend move up better place Then you will honored front everyone table you everyone who exalts himself will humbled one who humbles himself will

will full I tell you not one those men who invited will taste my banquet Large crowds now traveling Jesus He turned said them If anyone comes Me does not hate his father mother wife children brothers sisters yes even his own life he cannot My disciple whoever does not carry his cross follow Me cannot My disciple Which you wishing build tower does not first sit down count cost see if he has resources complete Otherwise if he lays foundation unable finish work everyone who sees will ridicule him saying This man could not finish what he started build Or what king on his way war another king will not first sit down consider whether he can engage ten thousand men one coming against him twenty thousand if he unable he will send delegation while other king still far off ask terms peace same way any one you who does not give up everything he has cannot My disciple Salt good but if salt loses its savor what will seasoned fit neither soil nor manure pile thrown out He who has ears hear let him hear Now all tax collectors sinners gathering around listen Jesus So Pharisees scribes began grumble This man welcomes sinners eats them Then Jesus told them this parable What man among you if he has hundred sheep loses one them does not leave ninety nine pasture go after one lost until he finds when he finds he joyfully puts on his shoulders comes home calls together his friends neighbors tell them Rejoice me I have found my lost sheep same way I tell you there will more joy heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety nine righteous ones who do not need repent Or what woman who has ten silver coins loses one them does not light lamp sweep her house search carefully until she finds when she finds she calls together her friends neighbors say Rejoice me I have found my lost coin same way I tell you there joy presence God angels over one sinner who repents Then Jesus said There man who had two sons younger son said him Father give me my share estate So he divided his property between them After few days younger son got everything together journeyed distant country where he squandered his wealth wild living After he had spent all he had severe famine swept through country he began need So he went hired himself out citizen country who sent him into his fields feed pigs He longed fill his belly pods pigs eating but no one would give him thing Finally he came his senses said How many my father hired servants have plenty food But here I am starving death I will get up go back my father say him Father I have sinned against heaven against you I am no longer worthy called your son Make me like one your hired servants So he got up went his father But while he still distance his father saw him filled compassion He ran his son embraced him kissed him son declared Father I have sinned against heaven against you I am no longer worthy called your son But father said his servants Quick Bring best robe put on him Put ring on his finger sandals on his feet Bring fattened calf kill Let us feast celebrate this son mine dead alive again He lost found So they began celebrate Meanwhile older son field he approached house he heard music dancing So he called one servants asked what going on Your brother has returned he said your father has killed fattened calf because he has him back safe sound older son became angry refused go So his father came out pleaded him But he answered his father Look all these years I have served you never disobeyed commandment yours Yet you never gave me even young goat so I could celebrate my friends But when this son yours returns from squandering your wealth prostitutes you kill fattened calf him Son you always me father said all mine yours But fitting celebrate glad because this brother yours dead alive again he lost found Jesus also said His disciples There rich man whose manager accused wasting his possessions So he called him ask What this I hear about you Turn account your management you cannot manager any longer manager said himself What shall I do now my master taking away my position I am too weak dig too ashamed beg I know what I will do so after my removal from management people will welcome me into their homes he called each one his master debtors How much do you owe my master he asked first hundred measures olive oil he answered Take your bill said manager Sit down quickly write fifty Then he asked another how much do you owe hundred measures wheat he replied Take your bill write eighty he told him master commended dishonest manager because he had acted shrewdly sons this age more shrewd dealing their own kind than sons light I tell you use worldly wealth make friends yourselves so when gone they will welcome you into eternal dwellings Whoever faithful very little will also faithful much whoever dishonest very little will also dishonest much So if you have not been faithful worldly wealth who will entrust you true riches if you have not been faithful belongings another who will give you belongings your own No servant can serve two masters Either he will hate one love other or he will devoted one despise other You cannot serve both God money Pharisees who lovers money heard all this scoffing Jesus So He said them You ones who justify yourselves before men but God knows your hearts what prized among men detestable before God Law Prophets proclaimed until John Since time gospel kingdom God being preached everyone forcing his way into But easier heaven earth pass away than single stroke pen drop out Law Anyone who divorces his wife marries another woman commits adultery he who marries divorced woman commits adultery Now there rich man dressed purple fine linen who lived each day joyous splendor beggar named Lazarus lay his gate covered sores longing fed crumbs fell from rich man table Even dogs came licked his sores One day beggar died carried by angels Abraham side rich man also died buried Hades where he torment he looked up saw Abraham from afar Lazarus by his side So he cried out Father Abraham have mercy on me send Lazarus dip tip his finger water cool my tongue I am agony this fire But Abraham answered Child remember during your lifetime you received your good things while Lazarus received bad things But now he comforted here while you agony besides all this great chasm has been fixed between us you so even those who wish cannot cross from here you nor can anyone cross from there us Then I beg you father he said send Lazarus my father house I have five brothers Let him warn them so they will not also end up this place torment But Abraham replied They have Moses prophets let your brothers listen them No father Abraham he said but if someone sent them from dead they will repent Then Abraham said him If they do not listen Moses prophets they will not persuaded even if someone rises from dead Jesus said His disciples inevitable stumbling blocks will come but woe one through whom they come would better him have millstone hung around his neck thrown into sea than cause one these little ones stumble Watch yourselves If your brother sins rebuke him if he repents forgive him Even if he sins against you seven times day seven times returns say I repent you must forgive him apostles said Lord Increase our faith Lord answered If you have faith size mustard seed you can say this mulberry tree uprooted planted sea will obey you Which you whose servant comes from plowing or shepherding field will say him Come once sit down eat Instead wont he tell him Prepare my meal dress yourself serve me while I eat drink afterward you may eat drink Does he thank servant because he did what he told So you also when you have done everything commanded you should say We unworthy servants we have only done our duty While Jesus on His way Jerusalem He passing between Samaria Galilee He entered one villages He met by ten lepers They stood distance raised their voices shouting Jesus Master have mercy on us When Jesus saw them He said Go show yourselves priests they on their way they cleansed When one them saw he healed he came back praising God loud voice He fell facedown Jesus feet thanksgiving Him he Samaritan not all ten cleansed Jesus asked Where then other nine no one found except this foreigner return give glory God Then Jesus said him Rise go your faith has made you well When asked by Pharisees when kingdom God would come Jesus replied kingdom God will not come observable signs Nor will people say Look here or There you see kingdom God your midst Then He said disciples time coming when you will long see one days Son Man but you will not see People will tell you Look there He or Look here He Do not go out or chase after them just lightning flashes lights up sky from one end other so will Son Man His day But first He must suffer many things rejected by this generation Just days Noah so also will days Son Man People eating drinking marrying being given marriage up day Noah entered ark Then flood came destroyed them all same days Lot People eating drinking buying selling planting building But on day Lot left Sodom fire sulfur rained down from heaven destroyed them all will just like on day Son Man revealed On day let no one on housetop come down retrieve his possessions Likewise let no one field return anything he has left behind Remember Lot wife Whoever tries save his life will lose but whoever loses his life will preserve I tell you on night two people will one bed One will taken other left Two women will grinding grain together One will taken other left Where Lord they asked Jesus answered Wherever there carcass there vultures will gather Then Jesus told them parable about their need pray all times not lose heart certain town there judge who neither feared God nor respected men there widow town who kept appealing him Give me justice against my adversary while he refused but later he said himself Though I neither fear God nor respect men yet because this widow keeps pestering me I will give her justice Then she will stop wearing me out her perpetual requests Lord said Listen words unjust judge Will not God bring about justice His elect who cry out Him day night Will He continue defer their help I tell you He will promptly carry out justice on their behalf Nevertheless when Son Man comes will He find faith on earth some who trusted their own righteousness viewed others contempt He also told this parable Two men went up temple pray One Pharisee other tax collector Pharisee stood by himself prayed God I thank You I am not like other men swindlers evildoers adulterers or even like this tax collector I fast twice week pay tithes all I acquire But tax collector stood distance unwilling even lift up his eyes heaven Instead he beat his breast said God have mercy on me sinner I tell you this man rather than Pharisee went home justified everyone who exalts himself will humbled but one who humbles himself will exalted Now people even bringing their babies Jesus Him place His hands on them when disciples saw this they rebuked those who brought them But Jesus called children Him said Let little children come Me do not hinder them kingdom God belongs such these Truly I tell you anyone who does not receive kingdom God like little child will never enter Then certain ruler asked Him Good Teacher what must I do inherit eternal life Why do you call Me good Jesus replied No one good except God alone You know commandments Do not commit adultery do not murder do not steal do not bear false witness honor your father mother All these I have kept from my youth he said On hearing this Jesus told him You still lack one thing Sell everything you own give poor you will have treasure heaven Then come follow Me But when ruler heard this he became very sad because he extremely wealthy Seeing man sadness Jesus said How hard rich enter kingdom God Indeed easier camel pass through eye needle than rich man enter kingdom God Those who heard this asked Who then can saved But Jesus said What impossible man possible God Look said Peter we have left all we had follow You Truly I tell you Jesus replied no one who has left home or wife or brothers or parents or children sake kingdom God will fail receive many times more this age age come eternal life Then Jesus took Twelve aside said them Look we going up Jerusalem everything prophets have written about Son Man will fulfilled He will delivered over Gentiles will mocked insulted spit upon They will flog Him kill Him on third day He will rise again But disciples did not understand any these things meaning hidden from them they did not comprehend what He saying Jesus drew near Jericho blind man sitting beside road begging When he heard crowd going by he asked what happening Jesus Nazareth passing by they told him So he called out Jesus Son David have mercy on me Those who led way admonished him silent but he cried out all louder Son David have mercy on me Jesus stopped directed man brought Him When he had been brought near Jesus asked him What do you want Me do you Lord he said let me see again Receive your sight Jesus replied Your faith has healed you Immediately he received his sight followed Jesus glorifying God all people who saw this gave praise God Then Jesus entered Jericho passing through there man named Zacchaeus chief tax collector who very wealthy He trying see who Jesus but could not see over crowd because he small stature So he ran on ahead climbed sycamore tree see Him since Jesus about pass way When Jesus came place He looked up said Zacchaeus hurry down I must stay your house today So Zacchaeus hurried down welcomed Him joyfully all who saw this began grumble saying He has gone guest sinful man But Zacchaeus stood up said Lord Look Lord half my possessions I give poor if I have cheated anyone I will repay fourfold Jesus said him Today salvation has come this house because this man too son Abraham Son Man came seek save lost While people listening this Jesus proceeded tell them parable because He near Jerusalem they thought kingdom God would appear imminently So He said man noble birth went distant country lay claim his kingship then return Beforehand he called ten his servants gave them ten minas Conduct business this until I return he said But his subjects hated him sent delegation after him say We do not want this man rule over us When he returned from procuring his kingship he summoned servants whom he had given money find out what each one had earned first servant came forward said Master your mina has produced ten more minas His master replied Well done good servant Because you have been faithful very small matter you shall have authority over ten cities second servant came said Master your mina has made five minas this one he said You shall have authority over five cities Then another servant came said Master here your mina which I have laid away piece cloth I afraid you because you harsh man You withdraw what you did not deposit reap what you did not sow His master replied You wicked servant I will judge you by your own words So you knew I am harsh man withdrawing what I did not deposit reaping what I did not sow Why then did you not deposit my money bank upon my return I could have collected interest Then he told those standing by Take mina from him give one who has ten minas Master they said he already has ten He replied I tell you everyone who has will given more but one who does not have even what he has will taken away from him these enemies mine who unwilling me rule over them bring them here slay them front me After Jesus had said this He went on ahead going up Jerusalem He approached Bethphage Bethany Mount Olives He sent out two His disciples saying Go into village ahead you you enter you will find colt tied there on which no one has ever sat Untie bring here If anyone asks Why you untying tell him Lord needs So those who sent went out found just Jesus had told them they untying colt its owners asked Why you untying colt Lord needs they answered Then they led colt Jesus threw their cloaks over put Jesus on He rode along people spread their cloaks on road He approached descent from Mount Olives whole multitude disciples began praise God joyfully loud voice all miracles they had seen Blessed King who comes name Lord Peace heaven glory highest But some Pharisees crowd said Him Teacher rebuke Your disciples I tell you He answered if they remain silent very stones will cry out Jesus approached Jerusalem saw city He wept over said If only you had known on this day what would bring you peace But now hidden from your eyes days will come upon you when your enemies will barricade you surround you hem you on every side They will level you ground you children within your walls They will not leave one stone on another because you did not recognize time your visitation from God Then Jesus entered temple courts began drive out those who selling there He declared them written My house will house prayer But you have made den robbers Jesus teaching temple every day but chief priests scribes leaders people intent on killing Him Yet they could not find way do so because all people hung on His words One day Jesus teaching people temple courts proclaiming gospel chief priests scribes together elders came up Him Tell us they said by what authority You doing these things who gave You this authority I will also ask you question Jesus replied Tell Me John baptism from heaven or from men They deliberated among themselves said If we say From heaven He will ask Why did you not believe him But if we say From men all people will stone us they convinced John prophet So they answered they did not know where from Jesus replied Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things Then He proceeded tell people this parable man planted vineyard rented out some tenants went away long time harvest time he sent servant tenants collect his share fruit vineyard But tenants beat servant sent him away empty handed So he sent another servant but they beat him treated him shamefully sending him away empty handed Then he sent third but they wounded him threw him out What shall I do asked owner vineyard I will send my beloved son Perhaps they will respect him But when tenants saw son they discussed among themselves said This heir Let us kill him inheritance will ours So they threw him out vineyard killed him What then will owner vineyard do them He will come kill those tenants will give vineyard others when people heard this they said May such thing never happen But Jesus looked directly them said Then what meaning which written stone builders rejected has become cornerstone Everyone who falls on this stone will broken pieces but he on whom falls will crushed When scribes chief priests realized Jesus had spoken this parable against them they sought arrest Him very hour But they afraid people So they watched Him closely sent spies who pretended sincere They hoping catch Him His words order hand Him over rule authority governor Teacher they inquired we know You speak teach correctly You show no partiality but teach way God accordance truth lawful us pay taxes Caesar or not But Jesus saw through their duplicity said them Show Me denarius Whose image inscription on Caesar they answered So Jesus told them Give Caesar what Caesar God what God they unable trap Him His words before people amazed His answer they fell silent Then some Sadducees who say there no resurrection came question Him Teacher they said Moses wrote us if man brother dies leaves wife but no children man marry his brother widow raise up offspring him Now there seven brothers first one married wife but died childless Then second third married widow same way all seven died leaving no children last all woman died So then resurrection whose wife will she all seven married her Jesus answered sons this age marry given marriage But those who considered worthy share age come resurrection from dead will neither marry nor given marriage fact they can no longer die because they like angels since they sons resurrection they sons God Even Moses demonstrates dead raised passage about burning bush he calls Lord God Abraham God Isaac God Jacob He not God dead but living Him all alive Some scribes answered Teacher You have spoken well they did not dare question Him any further Then Jesus declared How can said Christ Son David David himself says book Psalms Lord said my Lord Sit My right hand until I make Your enemies footstool Your feet Thus David calls Him Lord So how can He David son hearing all people Jesus said His disciples Beware scribes They like walk around long robes they love greetings marketplaces chief seats synagogues places honor banquets They defraud widows their houses show make lengthy prayers These men will receive greater condemnation Then Jesus looked up saw rich putting their gifts into treasury He saw poor widow put two small copper coins Truly I tell you He said this poor widow has put more than all others they all contributed out their surplus but she out her poverty has put all she had live on some disciples remarking how temple adorned beautiful stones consecrated gifts Jesus said what you see here time will come when not one stone will left on another every one will thrown down Teacher they asked when will these things happen what will sign they about take place Jesus answered See you not deceived many will come My name claiming I am He time near Do not follow them When you hear wars rebellions do not alarmed These things must happen first but end not imminent Then He told them Nation will rise against nation kingdom against kingdom There will great earthquakes famines pestilences various places along fearful sights great signs from heaven But before all this they will seize you persecute you On account My name they will deliver you synagogues prisons they will bring you before kings governors This will your opportunity serve witnesses So make up your mind not worry beforehand how defend yourselves I will give you speech wisdom none your adversaries will able resist or contradict You will betrayed even by parents brothers relatives friends some you will put death you will hated by everyone because My name Yet not even hair your head will perish By your patient endurance you will gain your souls But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies you will know her desolation near Then let those who Judea flee mountains let those city get out let those country stay out city these days vengeance fulfill all written How miserable those days will pregnant nursing mothers there will great distress upon land wrath against this people They will fall by edge sword led captive into all nations Jerusalem will trodden down by Gentiles until times Gentiles fulfilled There will signs sun moon stars on earth dismay among nations bewildered by roaring sea surging waves Men will faint from fear anxiety over what coming upon earth powers heavens will shaken time they will see Son Man coming cloud power great glory When these things begin happen stand up lift up your heads because your redemption drawing near Then Jesus told them parable Look fig tree all trees When they sprout leaves you can see yourselves know summer near So also when you see these things happening know kingdom God near Truly I tell you this generation will not pass away until all these things have happened Heaven earth will pass away but My words will never pass away But watch yourselves or your hearts will weighed down by dissipation drunkenness worries life day will spring upon you suddenly like snare will come upon all who dwell on face all earth So keep watch all times pray you may have strength escape all about happen stand before Son Man Every day Jesus taught temple but every evening He went out spend night on Mount Olives

My blood which poured out you Look hand My betrayer Mine on table Indeed Son Man will go has been determined but woe man who betrays Him Then they began question among themselves which them going do this dispute also arose among disciples which them would considered greatest So Jesus declared kings Gentiles lord over them those authority over them call themselves benefactors But you shall not like them Instead greatest among you should like youngest one who leads like one who serves who greater one who reclines table or one who serves not one who reclines But I am among you one who serves You ones who have stood by Me My trials I bestow on you kingdom just My Father has bestowed one on Me so you may eat drink My table My kingdom sit on thrones judging twelve tribes Israel Simon Simon Satan has asked sift each you like wheat But I have prayed you Simon your faith will not fail when you have turned back strengthen your brothers Lord said Peter I am ready go You even prison death But

world He world though world made through Him world did not recognize Him He came His own His own did not receive Him But all who did receive Him those who believed His name He gave right become children God children born not blood nor desire or will man but born God Word became flesh made His dwelling among us We have seen His glory glory one only Son from Father full grace truth John

happened Bethany beyond Jordan where John baptizing next day John saw Jesus coming toward him said Look Lamb God who takes away sin world This He whom I said man who comes after me has surpassed me because He before me I myself did not know Him but reason I came baptizing water He might revealed Israel Then John testified I saw Spirit descending from heaven like dove resting on Him I myself did

third day wedding took place Cana Galilee Jesus mother there Jesus His disciples had also been invited wedding When wine ran out Jesus mother said Him They have no more wine Woman why does this concern us Jesus replied My hour has not yet come His mother said servants Do whatever He tells you Now six stone water jars had been set there Jewish rites purification Each could hold from twenty thirty gallons Jesus told servants Fill jars water So they filled them brim Now draw some out He said take master banquet They did so master banquet tasted water had been turned into wine He did not know where from but servants who had drawn water knew Then he called bridegroom aside said Everyone serves fine wine first then cheap wine after guests drunk But you have saved fine wine until now Jesus performed this first His signs Cana Galilee He thus revealed His glory His disciples believed Him After this He went down Capernaum His mother brothers His disciples they stayed there few days When Jewish Passover near Jesus went up Jerusalem temple courts He found men selling cattle sheep doves money changers seated their tables So He made whip out cords drove all from temple courts both sheep cattle He poured out coins money changers overturned their tables those selling doves He said Get these out here How dare you turn My Father house into marketplace His disciples remembered written Zeal Your house will consume Me On account this Jews demanded What sign can You show us prove Your authority do these things Jesus answered Destroy this temple three days I will raise up again This temple took forty six years build Jews replied You going raise up three days But Jesus speaking about temple His body After He raised from dead His disciples remembered He had said this Then they believed Scripture word Jesus had spoken While He Jerusalem Passover Feast many people saw signs He doing believed His name But Jesus did not entrust Himself them He knew them all He did not need any testimony about man He knew what man Now there man Pharisees named Nicodemus leader Jews He came Jesus night said Rabbi we know You teacher who has come from God no one could perform signs You doing if God not him Jesus replied Truly truly I tell you no one can see kingdom God unless he born again How can man born when he old Nicodemus asked Can he enter his mother womb second time born Jesus answered Truly truly I tell you no one can enter kingdom God unless he born water Spirit Flesh born flesh but spirit born Spirit Do not amazed I said You must born again wind blows where wishes You hear its sound but you do not know where comes from or where going So everyone born Spirit How can this Nicodemus asked You Israel teacher said Jesus you do not understand these things Truly truly I tell you we speak what we know we testify what we have seen yet you people do not accept our testimony If I have told you about earthly things you do not believe how will you believe if I tell you about heavenly things No one has ascended into heaven except One who descended from heaventhe Son Man Just Moses lifted up snake wilderness so Son Man must lifted up everyone who believes Him may have eternal life God so loved world He gave His one only Son everyone who believes Him shall not perish but have eternal life God did not send His Son into world condemn world but save world through Him Whoever believes Him not condemned but whoever does not believe has already been condemned because he has not believed name God one only Son this verdict Light has come into world but men loved darkness rather than Light because their deeds evil Everyone who does evil hates Light does not come into Light fear his deeds will exposed But whoever practices truth comes into Light so may seen clearly what he has done has been accomplished God After this Jesus His disciples went into Judean countryside where He spent some time them baptized Now John also baptizing Aenon near Salim because water plentiful there people kept coming baptized John had not yet been thrown into prison Then dispute arose between John disciples certain Jew over issue ceremonial washing So John disciples came him said Look Rabbi One who you beyond Jordan One you testified about He baptizing everyone going Him John replied man can receive only what given him from heaven You yourselves can testify I said I am not Christ but am sent ahead Him bride belongs bridegroom friend bridegroom stands listens him overjoyed hear bridegroom voice joy mine now complete He must increase I must decrease One who comes from above above all one who from earth belongs earth speaks one from earth One who comes from heaven above all He testifies what He has seen heard yet no one accepts His testimony Whoever accepts His testimony has certified God truthful One whom God has sent speaks words God God gives Spirit without limit Father loves Son has placed all things His hands Whoever believes Son has eternal life Whoever rejects Son will not see life Instead wrath God remains on him When Jesus realized Pharisees aware He gaining baptizing more disciples than John although not Jesus who baptized but His disciples He left Judea returned Galilee Now He had pass through Samaria So He came town Samaria called Sychar near plot ground Jacob had given his son Joseph Since Jacob well there Jesus weary from His journey sat down by well about sixth hour When Samaritan woman came draw water Jesus said her Give Me drink His disciples had gone into town buy food You Jew said woman How can You ask drink from me Samaritan woman Jews do not associate Samaritans Jesus answered If you knew gift God who asking you drink you would have asked Him He would have given you living water Sir woman replied You have nothing draw well deep Where then will You get this living water You greater than our father Jacob who gave us this well drank from himself did his sons his livestock Jesus said her Everyone who drinks this water will thirsty again But whoever drinks water I give him will never thirst Indeed water I give him will become him fount water springing up eternal life woman said Him Sir give me this water so I will not get thirsty have keep coming here draw water Jesus told her Go call your husband come back I have no husband woman replied Jesus said her You correct say you have no husband fact you have had five husbands man you now have not your husband You have spoken truthfully Sir woman said I see You prophet Our fathers worshiped on this mountain but you Jews say place where one must worship Jerusalem Believe Me woman Jesus replied time coming when you will worship Father neither on this mountain nor Jerusalem You worship what you do not know we worship what we do know salvation from Jews But time coming has now come when true worshipers will worship Father spirit truth Father seeking such these worship Him God Spirit His worshipers must worship Him spirit truth woman said I know Messiah called Christ coming When He comes He will explain everything us Jesus answered I who speak you am He Just then His disciples returned surprised He speaking woman But no one asked Him What do You want from her or Why You talking her Then woman left her water jar went back into town said people Come see man who told me everything I ever did Could this Christ So they left town made their way toward Jesus Meanwhile disciples urged Him Rabbi eat something But He told them I have food eat you know nothing about So disciples asked one another Could someone have brought Him food Jesus explained My food do will Him who sent Me finish His work Do you not say There still four months until harvest I tell you lift up your eyes look fields they ripe harvest Already reaper draws his wages gathers crop eternal life so sower reaper may rejoice together this case saying One sows another reaps true I sent you reap what you have not worked others have done hard work now you have taken up their labor Many Samaritans from town believed Jesus because woman testimony He told me everything I ever did So when Samaritans came Him they asked Him stay them He stayed two days many more believed because His message They said woman We now believe not only because your words we have heard ourselves we know this man truly Savior world After two days Jesus left Galilee Now He Himself had testified prophet has no honor his own hometown Yet when He arrived Galileans welcomed Him They had seen all great things He had done Jerusalem feast they had gone there well So once again He came Cana Galilee where He had turned water into wine there royal official whose son lay sick Capernaum When he heard Jesus had come from Judea Galilee he went begged Him come down heal his son who about die Jesus said him Unless you people see signs wonders you will never believe Sir official said come down before my child dies Go said Jesus Your son will live man took Jesus His word departed while he still on way his servants met him news his boy alive So he inquired hour when his son had recovered they told him fever left him yesterday seventh hour Then father realized this very hour which Jesus had told him Your son will live he all his household believed This now second sign Jesus performed after coming from Judea into Galilee Some time later there feast Jews Jesus went up Jerusalem Now there Jerusalem near Sheep Gate pool five covered colonnades which Hebrew called Bethesda On these walkways lay great number sick blind lame paralyzed One man there had been invalid thirty eight years When Jesus saw him lying there realized he had spent long time this condition He asked him Do you want get well Sir invalid replied I have no one help me into pool when water stirred While I am on my way someone else goes before me Then Jesus told him Get up pick up your mat walk Immediately man made well he picked up his mat began walk Now this happened on Sabbath day so Jews said man who had been healed This Sabbath unlawful you carry your mat But he answered man who made me well told me Pick up your mat walk Who this man who told you pick up walk they asked But man who healed did not know who Jesus had slipped away while crowd there Afterward Jesus found man temple said him See you have been made well Stop sinning or something worse may happen you man went away told Jews Jesus who had made him well Now because Jesus doing these things on Sabbath Jews began persecute Him But Jesus answered them this very day My Father His work I too am working Because this Jews tried all harder kill Him Not only He breaking Sabbath but He even calling God His own Father making Himself equal God So Jesus replied Truly truly I tell you Son can do nothing by Himself unless He sees Father doing whatever Father does Son also does Father loves Son shows Him all He does your amazement He will show Him even greater works than these just Father raises dead gives them life so also Son gives life whom He wishes Furthermore Father judges no one but has assigned all judgment Son so all may honor Son just they honor Father Whoever does not honor Son does not honor Father who sent Him Truly truly I tell you whoever hears My word believes Him who sent Me has eternal life will not come under judgment Indeed he has crossed over from death life Truly truly I tell you hour coming has now come when dead will hear voice Son God those who hear will live Father has life Himself so also He has granted Son have life Himself He has given Him authority execute judgment because He Son Man Do not amazed this hour coming when all who their graves will hear His voice come out those who have done good resurrection life those who have done evil resurrection judgment I can do nothing by Myself I judge only I hear My judgment just because I do not seek My own will but will Him who sent Me If I testify about Myself My testimony not valid There another who testifies about Me I know His testimony about Me valid You have sent John he has testified truth Even though I do not accept human testimony I say these things so you may saved John lamp burned gave light you willing season bask his light But I have testimony more substantial than John works Father has given Me accomplish very works I am doing testify about Me Father has sent Me Father who sent Me has Himself testified about Me You have never heard His voice nor seen His form nor does His word abide you because you do not believe One He sent You pore over Scriptures because you presume by them you possess eternal life These very words testify about Me yet you refuse come Me have life I do not accept glory from men but I know you you do not have love God within you I have come My Father name you have not received Me but if someone else comes his own name you will receive him How can you believe if you accept glory from one another yet do not seek glory comes from only God Do not think I will accuse you before Father Your accuser Moses whom you have put your hope If you had believed Moses you would believe Me because he wrote about Me But since you do not believe what he wrote how will you believe what I say After this Jesus crossed other side Sea Galilee Sea Tiberias large crowd followed Him because they saw signs He performing on sick Then Jesus went up on mountain sat down His disciples Now Jewish Feast Passover near When Jesus looked up saw large crowd coming toward Him He said Philip Where can we buy bread these people eat But He asking this test him He knew what He about do Philip answered Two hundred denarii would not buy enough bread each them have small piece One His disciples Andrew Simon Peter brother said Him Here boy five barley loaves two small fish But what difference will these make among so many Have people sit down Jesus said Now there plenty grass place so men sat down about five thousand them Then Jesus took loaves fish gave thanks distributed those who seated much they wanted when everyone full He said His disciples Gather pieces left over so nothing will wasted So they collected them filled twelve baskets pieces five barley loaves left over by those who had eaten When people saw sign Jesus had performed they began say Truly this Prophet who come into world Then Jesus realizing they about come make Him king by force withdrew again mountain by Himself When evening came His disciples went down sea got into boat started across sea Capernaum already dark Jesus had not yet gone out them strong wind blowing sea grew agitated When they had rowed about three or four miles they saw Jesus approaching boat walking on sea they terrified But Jesus spoke up I do not afraid Then they willing take Him into boat once boat reached shore where they heading next day crowd had remained on other side sea realized only one boat had been there Jesus had not boarded His disciples but they had gone away alone However some boats from Tiberias landed near place where people had eaten bread after Lord had given thanks So when crowd saw neither Jesus nor His disciples there they got into boats went Capernaum look Him When they found Him on other side sea they asked Him Rabbi when did You get here Jesus replied Truly truly I tell you not because you saw these signs you looking Me but because you ate loaves had your fill Do not work food perishes but food endures eternal life which Son Man will give you on Him God Father has placed His seal approval Then they inquired What must we do perform works God Jesus replied work God this believe One He has sent So they asked Him What sign then will You perform so we may see believe You What will You do Our fathers ate manna wilderness written He gave them bread from heaven eat Jesus said them Truly truly I tell you not Moses who gave you bread from heaven but My Father who gives you true bread from heaven bread God He who comes down from heaven gives life world Sir they said give us this bread all times Jesus answered I am bread life Whoever comes Me will never hunger whoever believes Me will never thirst But I stated you have seen Me still you do not believe Everyone Father gives Me will come Me one who comes Me I will never drive away I have come down from heaven not do My own will but do will Him who sent Me this will Him who sent Me I shall lose none those He has given Me but raise them up last day My Father will everyone who looks Son believes Him shall have eternal life I will raise him up last day this Jews began grumble about Jesus because He had said I am bread came down from heaven They asking this not Jesus son Joseph whose father mother we know How then can He say I have come down from heaven Stop grumbling among yourselves Jesus replied No one can come Me unless Father who sent Me draws him I will raise him up last day written Prophets they will all taught by God Everyone who has heard Father learned from Him comes Me not anyone has seen Father except One who from God only He has seen Father Truly truly I tell you he who believes has eternal life I am bread life Your fathers ate manna wilderness yet they died This bread comes down from heaven so anyone may eat not die I am living bread came down from heaven If anyone eats this bread he will live forever this bread which I will give life world My flesh this Jews began argue among themselves How can this man give us His flesh eat So Jesus said them Truly truly I tell you unless you eat flesh drink blood Son Man you have no life you Whoever eats My flesh drinks My blood has eternal life I will raise him up last day My flesh real food My blood real drink Whoever eats My flesh drinks My blood remains Me I him Just living Father sent Me I live because Father so also one who feeds on Me will live because Me This bread came down from heaven Unlike your fathers who ate manna died one who eats this bread will live forever Jesus said this while teaching synagogue Capernaum On hearing many His disciples said This difficult teaching Who can accept Aware His disciples grumbling about this teaching Jesus asked them Does this offend you Then what will happen if you see Son Man ascend where He before Spirit gives life flesh profits nothing words I have spoken you spirit they life However there some you who do not believe Jesus had known from beginning which them did not believe who would betray Him Then Jesus said This why I told you no one can come Me unless Father has granted him From time on many His disciples turned back no longer walked Him So Jesus asked Twelve Do you want leave too Simon Peter replied Lord whom would we go You have words eternal life We believe know You Holy One God Jesus answered them Have I not chosen you Twelve Yet one you devil He speaking about Judas son Simon Iscariot although Judas one Twelve he later betray Jesus After this Jesus traveled throughout Galilee He did not want travel Judea because Jews there trying kill Him However Jewish Feast Tabernacles near So Jesus brothers said Him Leave here go Judea so Your disciples there may see works You doing no one who wants known publicly acts secret Since You doing these things show Yourself world even His own brothers did not believe Him Therefore Jesus told them Although your time always hand My time has not yet come world cannot hate you but hates Me because I testify its works evil Go up feast on your own I am not going up this feast because My time has not yet come Having said this Jesus remained Galilee But after His brothers had gone up feast He also went not publicly but secret So Jews looking Him feast asking Where He Many crowds whispering about Him Some said He good man But others replied No He deceives people Yet no one would speak publicly about Him fear Jews About halfway through feast Jesus went up temple courts began teach Jews amazed asked How did this man attain such learning without having studied My teaching not My own Jesus replied comes from Him who sent Me If anyone desires do His will he will know whether My teaching from God or whether I speak on My own He who speaks on his own authority seeks his own glory but He who seeks glory One who sent Him man truth Him there no falsehood Has not Moses given you law Yet not one you keeps Why you trying kill Me You have demon crowd replied Who trying kill You Jesus answered them I did one miracle you all amazed But because Moses gave you circumcision you circumcise boy on Sabbath not from Moses but from patriarchs If boy can circumcised on Sabbath so law Moses will not broken why you angry Me making whole man well on Sabbath Stop judging by outward appearances start judging justly Then some people Jerusalem began say Isnt this man they trying kill Yet here He speaking publicly they not saying anything Him Have rulers truly recognized this Christ But we know where this man from When Christ comes no one will know where He from Then Jesus still teaching temple courts cried out You know Me you know where I am from I have not come My own accord but He who sent Me true You do not know Him but I know Him because I am from Him He sent Me So they tried seize Him but no one laid hand on Him because His hour had not yet come Many crowd however believed Him said When Christ comes will He perform more signs than this man When Pharisees heard crowd whispering these things about Jesus they chief priests sent officers arrest Him So Jesus said I am you only little while longer then I am going One who sent Me You will look Me but you will not find Me where I am you cannot come this Jews said one another Where does He intend go we will not find Him Will He go where Jews dispersed among Greeks teach Greeks What does He mean by saying You will look Me but you will not find Me Where I am you cannot come On last greatest day feast Jesus stood up called out loud voice If anyone thirsty let him come Me drink Whoever believes Me Scripture has said Streams living water will flow from within him He speaking about Spirit whom those who believed Him later receive Spirit had not yet been given because Jesus had not yet been glorified On hearing these words some people said This truly Prophet Others declared This Christ But still others asked How can Christ come from Galilee Doesnt Scripture say Christ will come from line David from Bethlehem village where David lived So there division crowd because Jesus Some them wanted seize Him but no one laid hand on Him Then officers returned chief priests Pharisees who asked them Why didnt you bring Him Never has anyone spoken like this man officers answered Have you also been deceived replied Pharisees Have any rulers or Pharisees believed Him But this crowd does not know law they under curse Nicodemus who had gone Jesus earlier who himself one them asked Does our law convict man without first hearing from him determine what he has done Arent you also from Galilee they replied Look into you will see no prophet comes out Galilee Then each went his own home But Jesus went Mount Olives Early morning He went back into temple courts All people came Him He sat down teach them scribes Pharisees however brought Him woman caught adultery They made her stand before them said Teacher this woman caught act adultery Law Moses commanded us stone such woman So what do You say They said this test Him order have basis accusing Him But Jesus bent down began write on ground His finger When they continued question Him He straightened up said them Let him who without sin among you first cast stone her again He bent down wrote on ground When they heard this they began go away one by one beginning older ones until only Jesus left woman standing there Then Jesus straightened up asked her Woman where your accusers Has no one condemned you No one Lord she answered Then neither do I condemn you Jesus declared Now go sin no more Once again Jesus spoke people said I am light world Whoever follows Me will never walk darkness but will have light life So Pharisees said Him You testifying about Yourself Your testimony not valid Jesus replied Even if I testify about Myself My testimony valid because I know where I came from where I am going But you do not know where I came from or where I am going You judge according flesh I judge no one But even if I do judge My judgment true because I am not alone I am Father who sent Me Even your own Law written testimony two men valid I am One who testifies about Myself Father who sent Me also testifies about Me Where Your Father they asked Him You do not know Me or My Father Jesus answered If you knew Me you would know My Father well He spoke these words while teaching temple courts near treasury Yet no one seized Him because His hour had not yet come Again He said them I am going away you will look Me but you will die your sin Where I am going you cannot come So Jews began ask Will He kill Himself since He says Where I am going you cannot come Then He told them You from below I am from above You this world I am not this world why I told you you would die your sins unless you believe I am He you will die your sins Who You they asked Just what I have been telling you from beginning Jesus replied I have much say about you much judge But One who sent Me truthful what I have heard from Him I tell world They did not understand He telling them about Father So Jesus said When you have lifted up Son Man then you will know I am He I do nothing on My own but speak exactly what Father has taught Me He who sent Me Me He has not left Me alone because I always do what pleases Him Jesus spoke these things many believed Him So He said Jews who had believed Him If you continue My word you truly My disciples Then you will know truth truth will set you free We Abraham descendants they answered We have never been slaves anyone How can You say we will set free Jesus replied Truly truly I tell you everyone who sins slave sin slave not permanent member family but son

who sent Me Night coming when no one can work While I am world I am light world When Jesus had said this He spit on ground made some mud applied man eyes Then He told him Go wash Pool Siloam which means Sent So man went washed came back seeing this his neighbors those who had formerly seen him begging began ask Isnt this man who used sit beg Some claimed he but others said No he just looks like him But man kept saying I am one How then your eyes opened they asked He answered man they call Jesus made some mud anointed my eyes He told me go Siloam wash So I went washed received my sight Where He they asked I do not know he answered They brought Pharisees man who had been blind Now day on which Jesus had made mud opened his eyes Sabbath So Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight man answered He put mud on my eyes I washed now I can see Because this some Pharisees said This man not from God He does not keep Sabbath But others said How can sinful man perform such signs there division among them So once again they asked man who had been blind What do you say about Him since your eyes He opened He prophet man replied Jews still did not believe man had been blind had received his sight until they summoned his parents asked this your son one you say born blind So how he can now see His parents answered We know he our son we know he born blind But how he can now see or who opened his eyes we do not know Ask him He old enough speak himself His parents said this because they afraid Jews Jews had already determined anyone who confessed Jesus Christ would put out synagogue why his parents said He old enough Ask him So second time they called man who had been blind said Give glory God We know this man sinner He answered Whether He sinner I do not know There one thing I do know I blind but now I see What did He do you they asked How did He open your eyes He replied I already told you you did not listen Why do you want hear again Do you also want become His disciples Then they heaped insults on him said You His disciple we disciples Moses We know God spoke Moses but we do not know where this man from remarkable indeed man said You do not know where He from yet He opened my eyes We know God does not listen sinners but He does listen one who worships Him does His will Never before has anyone heard opening eyes man born blind If this man not from God He could do no such thing They replied You born utter sin you instructing us they threw him out When Jesus heard they had thrown him out He found man said Do you believe Son Man Who He Sir he replied Tell me so I may believe Him You have already seen Him Jesus answered He One speaking you Lord I believe he said he worshiped Jesus Then Jesus declared judgment I have come into this world so blind may see those who see may become blind Some Pharisees who Him heard this they asked Him we blind too If you blind Jesus replied you would not guilty sin But since you claim you can see your guilt remains Truly truly I tell you whoever does not enter sheepfold by gate but climbs some other way thief robber But one who enters by gate shepherd sheep gatekeeper opens gate him sheep listen his voice He calls his own sheep by name leads them out When he has brought out all his own he goes on ahead them his sheep follow him because they know his voice But they will never follow stranger fact they will flee from him because they do not recognize his voice Jesus spoke them using this illustration but they did not understand what He telling them So He said them again Truly truly I tell you I am gate sheep All who came before Me thieves robbers but sheep did not listen them I am gate If anyone enters through Me he will saved He will come go out find pasture thief comes only steal kill destroy I have come they may have life have all its fullness I am good shepherd good shepherd lays down His life sheep hired hand not shepherd sheep not his own When he sees wolf coming he abandons sheep runs away Then wolf pounces on them scatters flock man runs away because he hired servant unconcerned sheep I am good shepherd I know My sheep My sheep know Me just Father knows Me I know Father I lay down My life sheep I have other sheep not this fold I must bring them well they will listen My voice Then there will one flock one shepherd reason Father loves Me I lay down My life order take up again No one takes from Me but I lay down My own accord I have authority lay down authority take up again This charge I have received from My Father Again there division among Jews because Jesus message Many them said He demon possessed insane Why would you listen Him But others replied These not words man possessed by demon Can demon open eyes blind time Feast Dedication took place Jerusalem winter Jesus walking temple courts Solomon Colonnade So Jews gathered around Him demanded How long will You keep us suspense If You Christ tell us plainly I already told you Jesus replied but you did not believe works I do My Father name testify on My behalf But because you not My sheep you refuse believe My sheep listen My voice I know them they follow Me I give them eternal life they will never perish No one can snatch them out My hand My Father who has given them Me greater than all No one can snatch them out My Father hand I Father one this Jews again picked up stones stone Him But Jesus responded I have shown you many good works from Father which these do you stone Me We not stoning You any good work said Jews but blasphemy because You who man declare Yourself God Jesus replied not written your Law I have said you gods If he called them gods whom word God came Scripture cannot broken then what about One whom Father sanctified sent into world How then can you accuse Me blasphemy stating I am Son God If I am not doing works My Father then do not believe Me But if I am doing them even though you do not believe Me believe works themselves so you may know understand Father Me I am Father this they tried again seize Him but He escaped their grasp Then Jesus went back across Jordan place where John had first been baptizing He stayed there Many came Him said Although John never performed sign everything he said about this man true many place believed Jesus this time man named Lazarus sick He lived Bethany village Mary her sister Martha Mary whose brother Lazarus sick anoint Lord perfume wipe His feet her hair So sisters sent word Jesus Lord one You love sick When Jesus heard this He said This sickness will not end death No glory God so Son God may glorified through Now Jesus loved Martha her sister Lazarus So on hearing Lazarus sick He stayed where He two days then He said disciples Let us go back Judea Rabbi they replied Jews just tried stone You You going back there Jesus answered there not twelve hours daylight If anyone walks daytime he will not stumble because he sees by light this world But if anyone walks night he will stumble because he has no light After He had said this He told them Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep but I am going there wake him up His disciples replied Lord if he sleeping he will get better They thought Jesus talking about actual sleep but He speaking about death Lazarus So Jesus told them plainly Lazarus dead your sake I am glad I not there so you may believe But let us go him Then Thomas called Didymus said his fellow disciples Let us also go so we may die Him When Jesus arrived He found Lazarus had already spent four days tomb Now Bethany near Jerusalem little less than two miles away many Jews had come Martha Mary console them loss their brother So when Martha heard Jesus coming she went out meet Him but Mary stayed home Martha said Jesus Lord if You had been here my brother would not have died But even now I know God will give You whatever You ask Him Your brother will rise again Jesus told her Martha replied I know he will rise again resurrection last day Jesus said her I am resurrection life Whoever believes Me will live even though he dies everyone who lives believes Me will never die Do you believe this Yes Lord she answered I believe You Christ Son God who come into world After Martha had said this she went back called her sister Mary aside tell her Teacher here asking you when Mary heard this she got up quickly went Him Now Jesus had not yet entered village but still place where Martha had met Him When Jews who house consoling Mary saw how quickly she got up went out they followed her supposing she going tomb mourn there When Mary came Jesus saw Him she fell His feet said Lord if You had been here my brother would not have died When Jesus saw her weeping Jews who had come her also weeping He deeply moved spirit troubled Where have you put him He asked Come see Lord they answered Jesus wept Then Jews said See how He loved him But some them asked Could not this man who opened eyes blind also have kept Lazarus from dying Jesus once again deeply moved came tomb cave stone laid across entrance Take away stone Jesus said Lord by now he stinks said Martha sister dead man has already been four days Jesus replied Did I not tell you if you believed you would see glory God So they took away stone Then Jesus lifted His eyes upward said Father I thank You You have heard Me I knew You always hear Me but I say this benefit people standing here so they may believe You sent Me After Jesus had said this He called out loud voice Lazarus come out man who had been dead came out his hands feet bound strips linen his face wrapped cloth Unwrap him let him go Jesus told them Therefore many Jews who had come Mary had seen what Jesus did believed Him But some them went Pharisees told them what Jesus had done Then chief priests Pharisees convened Sanhedrin said What we do This man performing many signs If we let Him go on like this everyone will believe Him then Romans will come take away both our place our nation But one them named Caiaphas who high priest year said them You know nothing all You do not realize better you one man die people than whole nation perish Caiaphas did not say this on his own Instead high priest year he prophesying Jesus would die nation not only nation but also scattered children God gather them together into one So from day on they plotted kill Him result Jesus no longer went about publicly among Jews but He withdrew town called Ephraim area near wilderness He stayed there disciples Now Jewish Passover near many people went up from country Jerusalem purify themselves before Passover They kept looking Jesus asking one another they stood temple courts What do you think Will He come feast all But chief priests Pharisees had given orders anyone who knew where He must report so they could arrest Him Six days before Passover Jesus came Bethany hometown Lazarus whom He had raised from dead So they hosted dinner Jesus there Martha served Lazarus among those reclining table Him Then Mary took about pint expensive perfume made pure nard she anointed Jesus feet wiped them her hair house filled fragrance perfume But one His disciples Judas Iscariot who going betray Him asked Why wasnt this perfume sold three hundred denarii money given poor Judas did not say this because he cared about poor but because he thief keeper money bag he used take from what put into Leave her alone Jesus replied She has kept this perfume preparation day My burial poor you will always have you but you will not always have Me Meanwhile large crowd Jews learned Jesus there they came not only because Him but also see Lazarus whom He had raised from dead So chief priests made plans kill Lazarus well on account him many Jews deserting them believing Jesus next day great crowd had come feast heard Jesus coming Jerusalem They took palm branches went out meet Him shouting Hosanna Blessed He who comes name Lord Blessed King Israel Finding young donkey Jesus sat on written Do not afraid O Daughter Zion See your King coming seated on colt donkey first His disciples did not understand these things but after Jesus glorified they remembered what had been done Him they realized these very things had also been written about Him Meanwhile many people continued testify they had been Jesus when He called Lazarus from tomb raised him from dead also why crowd went out meet Him because they heard He had performed this sign Then Pharisees said one another You can see this doing you no good Look how whole world has gone after Him Now there some Greeks among those who went up worship feast They came Philip who from Bethsaida Galilee requested him Sir we want see Jesus Philip relayed this appeal Andrew both them went told Jesus But Jesus replied hour has come Son Man glorified Truly truly I tell you unless kernel wheat falls ground dies remains only seed but if dies bears much fruit Whoever loves his life will lose but whoever hates his life this world will keep eternal life If anyone serves Me he must follow Me where I am My servant will well If anyone serves Me Father will honor him Now My soul troubled what shall I say Father save Me from this hour No this purpose I have come this hour Father glorify Your name Then voice came from heaven I have glorified I will glorify again crowd standing there heard said had thundered Others said angel had spoken Him response Jesus said This voice not My benefit but yours Now judgment upon this world now prince this world will cast out I when I am lifted up from earth will draw everyone Myself He said this indicate kind death He going die crowd replied We have heard from Law Christ will remain forever So how can you say Son Man must lifted up Who this Son Man Then Jesus told them little while longer Light will among you Walk while you have Light so darkness will not overtake you one who walks darkness does not know where he going While you have Light believe Light so you may become sons light After Jesus had spoken these things He went away hidden from them Although Jesus had performed so many signs their presence they still did not believe Him This fulfill word Isaiah prophet Lord who has believed our message whom has arm Lord been revealed this reason they unable believe again Isaiah says He has blinded their eyes hardened their hearts so they cannot see their eyes understand their hearts turn I would heal them Isaiah said these things because he saw Jesus glory spoke about Him Nevertheless many leaders believed Him but because Pharisees they did not confess Him fear they would put out synagogue they loved praise from men more than praise from God Then Jesus cried out Whoever believes Me does not believe Me alone but One who sent Me whoever sees Me sees One who sent Me I have come into world light so no one who believes Me should remain darkness anyone who hears My words does not keep them I do not judge him I have not come judge world but save world There judge one who rejects Me does not receive My words word I have spoken will judge him on last day I have not spoken on My own but Father who sent Me has commanded Me what say how say I know His command leads eternal life So I speak exactly what Father

put into heart Judas son Simon Iscariot betray Jesus Jesus knew Father had delivered all things into His hands He had come from God returning God So He got up from supper laid aside His outer garments wrapped towel around His waist After He poured water into basin began wash disciples feet dry them towel around Him He came Simon Peter who asked Him Lord You going wash my feet Jesus replied You do not realize now what I am doing but later you will understand Never shall You wash my feet Peter told Him Jesus answered Unless I wash you you have no part Me Then Lord Simon Peter replied not only my feet but my hands my head well Jesus told him Whoever has already bathed needs only wash his feet he will completely clean you clean though not all you He knew who would betray Him why He said Not all you clean When Jesus had washed their feet put on His outer garments He reclined them again asked Do you know what I have done you You call Me Teacher Lord rightly so because I am So if I your Lord Teacher have washed your feet you also should wash one another feet I have set you example so you should do I have done you Truly truly I tell you no servant greater than his master nor messenger

lifted up his heel against Me I am telling you now before happens so when comes pass you will believe I am He Truly truly I tell you whoever receives one I send receives Me whoever receives Me

prophets from Samuel on many have spoken have proclaimed these days you sons prophets covenant God made your fathers when He said Abraham Through your offspring all families earth will blessed When God raised up His Servant He sent Him first you bless you by turning each you from your wicked ways While Peter John speaking people priests captain temple guard Sadducees came up them greatly disturbed they teaching people proclaiming Jesus resurrection dead They seized Peter John because evening they put them custody until next day But many who heard message believed number men grew about five thousand next day rulers elders scribes assembled Jerusalem along Annas high priest Caiaphas John Alexander many others from high priest family They had Peter John brought began question them By

known all you all people Israel by name Jesus Christ Nazareth whom you crucified but whom God raised from dead this man stands before you healed This Jesus stone you builders rejected which has become cornerstone Salvation exists no one else there no other name under heaven given men by which we must saved When they saw boldness Peter John realized they unschooled ordinary men they marveled took note these men had been Jesus seeing man who had been healed standing there them they had nothing say response So they ordered them leave Sanhedrin then conferred together What shall we do these men they asked clear everyone living Jerusalem remarkable miracle has occurred through them we cannot deny But keep this message from spreading any further among people we must warn them not speak anyone this name Then they called them again commanded them not speak or teach all name Jesus But Peter John replied Judge yourselves whether right God sight listen you rather than God we cannot stop speaking about what we have seen heard After further threats they let them go They could not find way punish them because all people glorifying God what had happened man who miraculously healed over forty years old On their release Peter John returned their own people reported everything chief priests elders had said them When believers heard this they lifted up their voices God one accord Sovereign Lord they said You made heaven earth sea everything them You spoke by Holy Spirit through mouth Your servant our father David Why do nations rage peoples plot vain kings earth take their stand rulers gather together against Lord against His Anointed One fact this very city where Herod Pontius Pilate conspired Gentiles people Israel against Your holy servant Jesus whom You anointed They carried out what Your hand will had decided beforehand would happen now Lord consider their threats enable Your servants speak Your word complete boldness You stretch out Your hand heal perform signs wonders through name Your holy servant Jesus After they had prayed their meeting place shaken they all filled Holy Spirit spoke word God boldly multitude believers one heart soul No one claimed any his possessions his own but they shared everything they owned great power apostles continued give their testimony about resurrection Lord Jesus abundant grace upon them all There no needy ones among them because those who owned lands or houses would sell their property bring proceeds from sales lay them apostles feet distribution anyone he had need Joseph Levite from Cyprus whom apostles called Barnabas meaning Son Encouragement sold field he owned brought money laid apostles feet Now man named Ananias together his wife Sapphira also sold piece property his wife full knowledge he kept back some proceeds himself but brought portion laid apostles feet Then Peter said Ananias how Satan has filled your heart lie Holy Spirit withhold some proceeds from land Did not belong you before sold after sold not your disposal How could you conceive such deed your heart You have not lied men but God On hearing these words Ananias fell down died great fear came over all who heard what had happened Then young men stepped forward wrapped up his body carried him out buried him About three hours later his wife also came unaware what had happened Tell me said Peter this price you your husband got land Yes she answered price How could you agree test Spirit Lord Peter replied Look feet men who buried your husband door they will carry you out also instant she fell down his feet died Then young men came finding her dead carried her out buried her beside her husband great fear came over whole church all who heard about these events apostles performed many signs wonders among people one accord believers gathered together Solomon Colonnade Although people regarded them highly no one else dared join them Yet more more believers brought Lord large numbers both men women result people brought sick into streets laid them on cots mats so least Peter shadow might fall on some them he passed by Crowds also gathered from towns around Jerusalem bringing sick those tormented by unclean spirits all them healed Then high priest all his associates who belonged party Sadducees filled jealousy They went out arrested apostles put them public jail But during night angel Lord opened doors jail brought them out saying Go stand temple courts tell people full message this new life daybreak apostles entered temple courts they had been told began teach people When high priest his associates arrived they convened Sanhedrinthe full assembly elders Israel sent jail apostles But on arriving jail officers did not find them there So they returned report We found jail securely locked guards posted doors but when we opened them we found no one inside When captain temple guard chief priests heard this account they perplexed what happening Then someone came announced Look men you put jail standing temple courts teaching people point captain went officers brought apostles but not by force fear people would stone them They brought them made them stand before Sanhedrin where high priest interrogated them We gave you strict orders not teach this name he said Yet you have filled Jerusalem your teaching determined make us responsible this man blood But Peter other apostles replied We must obey God rather than men God our fathers raised up Jesus whom you had killed by hanging Him on tree God exalted Him His right hand Prince Savior order grant repentance forgiveness sins Israel We witnesses these things so Holy Spirit whom God has given those who obey Him When Council members heard this they enraged they resolved put apostles death But Pharisee named Gamaliel teacher law who honored by all people stood up Sanhedrin ordered men put outside short time Men Israel he said consider carefully what you about do these men Some time ago Theudas rose up claiming somebody about four hundred men joined him He killed all his followers dispersed all came nothing After him Judas Galilean appeared days census drew away people after him He too perished all his followers scattered So present case I advise you Leave these men alone Let them go if their purpose or endeavor human origin will fail But if from God you will not able stop them You may even find yourselves fighting against God this they yielded Gamaliel They called apostles had them flogged Then they ordered them not speak name Jesus released them apostles left Sanhedrin rejoicing they had been counted worthy suffering disgrace Name Every day temple courts from house house they did not stop teaching proclaiming good news Jesus Christ those days when disciples increasing number Grecian Jews among them began grumble against Hebraic Jews because their widows being overlooked daily distribution food So Twelve summoned all disciples said unacceptable us neglect word God order wait on tables Therefore brothers select from among you seven men confirmed full Spirit wisdom We will appoint this responsibility them will devote ourselves prayer ministry word This proposal pleased whole group They chose Stephen man full faith Holy Spirit well Philip Prochorus Nicanor Timon Parmenas Nicolas from Antioch convert Judaism They presented these seven apostles who prayed laid their hands on them So word God continued spread number disciples Jerusalem grew rapidly great number priests became obedient faith Now Stephen who full grace power performing great wonders signs among people But resistance arose from what called Synagogue Freedmen including Cyrenians Alexandrians men from provinces Cilicia Asia They began argue Stephen but they could not stand up his wisdom or Spirit by whom he spoke Then they prompted some men say We heard Stephen speak words blasphemy against Moses against God So they stirred up people elders scribes confronted Stephen They seized him brought him before Sanhedrin where they presented false witnesses who said This man never stops speaking against this holy place against law we have heard him say Jesus Nazareth will destroy this place change customs Moses handed down us All who sitting Sanhedrin looked intently Stephen they saw his face like face angel Then high priest asked Stephen these charges true Stephen declared Brothers fathers listen me God glory appeared our father Abraham while he still Mesopotamia before he lived Haran told him Leave your country your kindred go land I will show you So Abraham left land Chaldeans settled Haran After his father died God brought him out place into this land where you now living He gave him no inheritance here not even foot ground But God promised give possession land Abraham his descendants even though he did not yet have child God told him his descendants would foreigners strange land they would enslaved mistreated four hundred years But I will punish nation enslaves them God said afterward they will come forth worship Me this place Then God gave Abraham covenant circumcision Abraham became father Isaac circumcised him on eighth day Isaac became father Jacob Jacob twelve patriarchs Because patriarchs jealous Joseph they sold him slave into Egypt But God him rescued him from all his troubles He granted Joseph favor wisdom sight Pharaoh king Egypt who appointed him ruler over Egypt all his household Then famine great suffering swept across Egypt Canaan our fathers could not find food When Jacob heard there grain Egypt he sent our fathers on their first visit On their second visit Joseph revealed his identity his brothers his family became known Pharaoh Then Joseph sent his father Jacob all his relatives seventy five all So Jacob went down Egypt where he our fathers died Their bones carried back Shechem placed tomb Abraham had bought from sons Hamor Shechem price he paid silver time drew near God fulfill His promise Abraham our people Egypt increased greatly number Then another king who knew nothing Joseph arose over Egypt He exploited our people oppressed our fathers forcing them abandon their infants so they would die time Moses born he beautiful sight God three months he nurtured his father house When he set outside Pharaoh daughter took him brought him up her own son So Moses educated all wisdom Egyptians powerful speech action When Moses forty years old he decided visit his brothers children Israel when he saw one them being mistreated Moses went his defense avenged him by striking down Egyptian who oppressing him He assumed his brothers would understand God using him deliver them but they did not next day he came upon two Israelites who fighting he tried reconcile them saying Men you brothers Why you mistreating each other But man who abusing his neighbor pushed Moses aside said Who made you ruler judge over us Do you want kill me you killed Egyptian yesterday this remark Moses fled land Midian where he lived foreigner had two sons After forty years had passed angel appeared Moses flames burning bush desert near Mount Sinai When Moses saw he marveled sight he approached look more closely voice Lord came

hearts turned back Egypt They said Aaron Make us gods who will go before us this Moses who led us out land Egypt we do not know what has happened him time they made calf offered sacrifice idol rejoicing works their hands But God turned away from them gave them over worship host heaven written book prophets Did you bring Me sacrifices offerings forty years wilderness O house Israel You have

God had directed Moses according pattern he had seen our fathers who received brought Joshua when they dispossessed nations God drove out before them remained until time David who found favor sight God asked provide dwelling place God Jacob But Solomon who built house Him However Most High does not dwell houses made by human hands prophet says Heaven My throne earth My footstool What kind house will you build Me says Lord or where will My place repose Has not My hand made all these things You stiff necked people uncircumcised hearts ears You always resist Holy Spirit just your fathers did Which prophets did your fathers fail persecute They even killed those who foretold coming Righteous One now you His betrayers murderers you who received law ordained by angels yet have not kept On hearing this members Sanhedrin enraged they gnashed their teeth him But Stephen full Holy Spirit looked intently into heaven saw glory God Jesus standing right hand God Look he said I see heaven open Son Man standing right hand God this they covered their ears cried out loud voice rushed together him They dragged him out city began stone him Meanwhile witnesses laid their garments feet young man named Saul While they stoning him Stephen appealed Lord Jesus receive my spirit Falling on his knees he cried out loud voice Lord do not hold this sin against them when he had said this he fell asleep Saul there giving approval Stephen death On day great persecution broke out against church Jerusalem all except apostles scattered throughout Judea Samaria God fearing men buried Stephen mourned

men women Even Simon himself believed baptized He followed Philip closely astounded by great signs miracles he observed When apostles Jerusalem heard Samaria had received word God they sent Peter John them On their arrival they prayed them receive Holy Spirit Holy Spirit had not yet fallen upon any them they had simply been baptized into name Lord Jesus Then Peter John laid their hands on them they received Holy Spirit When Simon saw Spirit given through laying on apostles hands he offered them money Give me this power well he said so everyone on whom I lay my hands may receive Holy Spirit But Peter replied May your silver perish you because you thought you could buy gift God money You have no part or share our ministry because your heart not right before God Repent therefore your wickedness pray Lord Perhaps He will forgive you intent your heart I see you poisoned by bitterness captive iniquity Then Simon answered Pray Lord me so nothing you have said may happen me after Peter John had testified spoken word Lord they returned Jerusalem preaching gospel many Samaritan villages Now angel Lord said Philip Get up go south desert road goes down from Jerusalem Gaza So he started

urged them continue this message on next Sabbath After synagogue dismissed many Jews devout converts Judaism followed Paul Barnabas who spoke them urged them continue grace God On following Sabbath nearly whole city gathered hear word Lord But when Jews saw crowds they filled jealousy they blasphemously contradicted what Paul saying Then Paul Barnabas answered them boldly necessary speak word God you first But since you reject do not consider yourselves worthy eternal life we now turn Gentiles this what Lord has commanded us I have made you light Gentiles bring salvation ends earth When Gentiles heard this they rejoiced glorified word Lord all who appointed eternal life believed word Lord spread throughout region Jews however incited religious women prominence leading men city They stirred up persecution against Paul Barnabas drove them out their district So they shook dust off their feet protest against them went Iconium disciples filled joy Holy Spirit Iconium Paul Barnabas went usual into Jewish synagogue where they spoke so well great number Jews Greeks believed But unbelieving Jews stirred up Gentiles poisoned their minds against brothers So Paul Barnabas spent considerable time there speaking boldly Lord who affirmed message His grace by enabling them perform signs wonders people city divided Some sided Jews others apostles But when Gentiles Jews together their rulers set out mistreat stone them they found out about fled Lycaonian cities Lystra Derbe surrounding region where they continued preach gospel Lystra there sat man crippled his feet who lame from birth had never walked This man listening words Paul who looked intently him saw he had faith healed loud voice Paul called out Stand up on your feet man jumped up began walk When crowds saw what Paul had done they lifted up their voices Lycaonian language gods have come down us human form Barnabas they called Zeus Paul they called Hermes because he chief speaker priest Zeus whose temple just outside city brought bulls wreaths city gates hoping offer sacrifice along crowds But when apostles Barnabas Paul found out about this they tore their clothes rushed into crowd shouting Men why you doing this We too only men human like you We bringing you good news you should turn from these worthless things living God who made heaven earth sea everything them past generations He let all nations go their own way Yet He has not left Himself without testimony His goodness He gives you rain from heaven fruitful seasons filling your hearts food gladness Even these words Paul Barnabas could hardly stop crowds from sacrificing them Then some Jews arrived from Antioch Iconium won over crowds They stoned Paul dragged him outside city presuming he dead But after disciples had gathered around him he got up went back into city next day he left Barnabas Derbe They preached gospel city made many disciples Then they returned Lystra Iconium Antioch strengthening souls disciples encouraging them continue faith We must endure many hardships enter kingdom God they said Paul Barnabas appointed elders them each church praying fasting they entrusted them Lord whom they had believed After passing through Pisidia they came Pamphylia when they had spoken word Perga they went down Attalia From Attalia they sailed Antioch where they had been commended grace God work they had just completed When they arrived they gathered church together reported all God had done through them how He had opened door faith Gentiles they spent long time there disciples Then some men came down from Judea teaching brothers Unless you circumcised according custom Moses you cannot saved after engaging these men sharp debate Paul Barnabas appointed along some other believers go up Jerusalem see apostles elders about this question Sent on their way by church they passed through Phoenicia Samaria recounting conversion Gentiles bringing great joy all brothers On their arrival Jerusalem they welcomed by church apostles elders whom they reported all God had done through them But some believers from party Pharisees stood up declared Gentiles must circumcised required obey law Moses So apostles elders met look into this matter After much discussion Peter got up said them Brothers you know early days God made choice among you Gentiles would hear from my lips message gospel believe God who knows heart showed His approval by giving Holy Spirit them just He did us He made no distinction between us them He cleansed their hearts by faith Now then why do you test God by placing on necks disciples yoke neither we nor our fathers have been able bear On contrary we believe through grace Lord Jesus we saved just they whole assembly fell silent they listened Barnabas Paul describing signs wonders God had done among Gentiles through them When they had finished speaking James declared Brothers listen me Simon has told us how God first visited Gentiles take from them people His own words prophets agree this written After this I will return rebuild fallen tent David Its ruins I will rebuild I will restore so remnant men may seek Lord all Gentiles who called by My name says Lord who does these things have been known ages my judgment therefore we should not cause trouble Gentiles who turning God Instead we should write tell them abstain from food polluted by idols from sexual immorality from meat strangled animals from blood Moses has been proclaimed every city from ancient times read synagogues on every Sabbath Then apostles elders whole church decided select men from among them send Antioch Paul Barnabas They chose Judas called Barsabbas Silas two leaders among brothers sent them this letter apostles elders your brothers brothers among Gentiles Antioch Syria Cilicia Greetings has come our attention some went out from us without our authorization unsettled you troubling your minds by what they said So we all agreed choose men send you along our beloved Barnabas Paul men who have risked their lives name our Lord Jesus Christ Therefore we sending Judas Silas tell you person same things we writing seemed good Holy Spirit us not burden you anything beyond these essential requirements You must abstain from food sacrificed idols from blood from meat strangled animals from sexual immorality You will do well avoid these things Farewell So men sent off went down Antioch where they assembled congregation delivered letter When people read they rejoiced its encouraging message Judas Silas who themselves prophets said much encourage strengthen brothers After spending some time there they sent off by brothers peace return those who had sent them But Paul Barnabas remained Antioch along many others teaching preaching word Lord Some time later Paul said Barnabas Let us go back visit brothers every town where we proclaimed word Lord see how they doing Barnabas wanted take John also called Mark But Paul thought best not take him because he had deserted them Pamphylia had not accompanied them work Their disagreement so sharp they parted company Barnabas took Mark sailed Cyprus but Paul chose Silas left commended by brothers grace Lord he traveled through

he met each day Some Epicurean Stoic philosophers also began debate him Some them asked What this babbler trying say Others said He seems advocating foreign gods They said this because Paul proclaiming good news Jesus resurrection So they took Paul brought him Areopagus where they asked him May we know what this new teaching you presenting you bringing some strange notions our ears we want know what they mean Now all Athenians foreigners who lived there spent their time doing nothing more than hearing articulating new ideas Then Paul stood up meeting Areopagus said Men Athens I see every way you very religious I walked around examined your objects worship I even found altar this inscription UNKNOWN GOD Therefore what you worship something unknown I now proclaim you God who made world everything Lord heaven earth does not live temples made by human hands Nor He served by human hands if He needed anything because He Himself gives everyone life breath everything else From one man He made every nation men they should inhabit whole earth He determined their appointed times boundaries their lands God intended they would seek Him perhaps reach out Him find Him though He not far from each one us Him we live move have our being some your own poets have said We His offspring Therefore being offspring God we should not think Divine Being like gold or silver or stone image formed by man skill imagination Although God overlooked ignorance earlier times He now commands all people everywhere repent He has set day when He will judge world justice by Man He has appointed He has given proof this everyone by raising Him from dead When they heard about resurrection dead some began mock him but others said We want hear you again on this topic Paul left Areopagus But some joined him believed including Dionysius Areopagite woman named Damaris others who them After this Paul left Athens went Corinth There he found Jew named Aquila native Pontus who had recently come from Italy his wife Priscilla because Claudius had ordered all Jews leave Rome Paul went visit them he stayed worked them because they tentmakers by trade just he Every Sabbath he reasoned synagogue trying persuade Jews Greeks alike when Silas Timothy came down from Macedonia Paul devoted himself fully word testifying Jews Jesus Christ But when they opposed insulted him he shook out his garments told

believed Lord many Corinthians who heard message believed baptized One night Lord spoke Paul vision Do not afraid keep on speaking do not silent I am you no one will lay hand on you because I have many people this city So Paul stayed year half teaching word God among Corinthians While Gallio proconsul Achaia Jews coordinated attack on Paul brought him before judgment seat This man persuading people worship God ways contrary law they said But just Paul about speak Gallio told Jews If this matter involved wrongdoing or vicious crime O Jews would reasonable me hear your complaint But since dispute about words names your own law settle yourselves I refuse judge such things he drove them away from judgment seat this crowd seized Sosthenes synagogue leader beat him front judgment seat But none this concern Gallio Paul remained Corinth quite some time before saying goodbye brothers He had his head shaved Cenchrea keep vow he had made then he sailed Syria accompanied by Priscilla Aquila When they reached Ephesus Paul parted ways Priscilla Aquila He himself went into synagogue there reasoned Jews When they asked him stay while longer he declined But he left he said I will come back

accurately When Apollos resolved cross over Achaia brothers encouraged him wrote disciples there welcome him On his arrival he great help those who by grace had believed he powerfully refuted Jews public debate proving from Scriptures Jesus Christ While Apollos Corinth Paul passed through interior came Ephesus There he found some disciples asked them Did you receive Holy Spirit when you became believers No they answered we have not even heard there Holy Spirit Into what then you baptized Paul asked baptism John they replied Paul explained John baptism baptism repentance He told people believe One coming after him Jesus On hearing this they baptized into name Lord Jesus when Paul laid his hands on them Holy Spirit came upon them they spoke tongues prophesied There about twelve men all Then Paul went into synagogue spoke boldly there three months arguing persuasively about kingdom God But when some them stubbornly refused believe publicly maligned Way Paul took his disciples left synagogue conduct daily discussions lecture hall Tyrannus This continued two years so everyone who lived province Asia Jews Greeks alike heard word Lord God did extraordinary miracles through hands Paul so even handkerchiefs aprons had touched him taken sick diseases evil spirits left them Now there some itinerant Jewish exorcists who tried invoke name Lord Jesus over those evil spirits They would say I bind you by Jesus whom Paul proclaims Seven sons Sceva Jewish chief priest doing this Eventually one evil spirits answered them Jesus I know I know about Paul but who you Then man evil spirit jumped on them overpowered them all attack so violent they ran out house naked wounded This became known all Jews Greeks living Ephesus fear came over all them So name Lord Jesus held high honor Many who had believed now came forward confessing disclosing their deeds number those who had practiced magic arts brought their books burned them front everyone When value books calculated total came fifty thousand drachmas So word Lord powerfully continued spread prevail After these things had happened Paul resolved Spirit go Jerusalem after he had passed through Macedonia Achaia After I have been there he said I must see Rome well He sent two his helpers Timothy Erastus Macedonia while he stayed time province Asia About time there arose great disturbance about Way began silversmith named Demetrius who made silver shrines Artemis bringing much business craftsmen Demetrius assembled craftsmen along workmen related trades Men he said you know this business our source prosperity you can see hear not only Ephesus but nearly whole province Asia Paul has persuaded great number people turn away He says man made gods no gods all There danger not only our business will fall into

every way everywhere most excellent Felix we acknowledge this all gratitude But order not burden you any further I beg your indulgence hear us briefly We have found this man pestilence stirring up dissension among Jews all over world He ringleader sect Nazarenes he even tried desecrate temple so we seized him By examining him yourself you will able learn truth about all our charges against him Jews concurred asserting these charges true When governor motioned Paul speak he began his response Knowing you have been judge over this nation many years I gladly make my defense You can verify yourself no more than twelve days ago I went up Jerusalem worship Yet my accusers did not find me debating anyone temple or riling up crowd synagogues or city Nor can they prove you any their charges against me I do confess you however I worship God our fathers according Way which they call sect I believe everything laid down by Law written Prophets I have same hope God they themselves cherish there will resurrection both righteous wicked this hope I strive always maintain clear conscience before God man After several years then I returned Jerusalem bring alms my people present offerings time they found me temple I ceremonially clean not inciting crowd or uproar But there some Jews from province Asia who ought appear before you bring charges if they have anything against me Otherwise let these men state themselves any crime they found me when I stood before Sanhedrin unless this one thing I called out I stood their presence concerning resurrection dead I am on trial before you today Then Felix who well informed about Way adjourned hearing said When Lysias commander comes I will decide your case He ordered centurion keep Paul under guard but allow him some freedom permit his friends minister his needs After several days Felix returned his wife Drusilla who Jewess He sent Paul listened him speak about faith Christ Jesus Paul expounded on righteousness self control coming judgment Felix became frightened said You may go now When I find time I will call you same time he hoping Paul would offer him bribe So he sent Paul frequently talked him After two years had passed Felix succeeded by Porcius Festus wishing do Jews favor Felix left Paul prison Three days after his arrival province Festus went up from Caesarea Jerusalem where chief priests Jewish leaders presented their case against Paul They urged Festus grant them concession against Paul by summoning him Jerusalem because they preparing ambush kill him along way But Festus replied Paul being held Caesarea I myself am going there soon So if this man has done anything wrong let some your leaders come down me accuse him there After spending no more than eight or ten days them Festus went down Caesarea next day he sat on judgment seat ordered Paul brought When Paul arrived Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him bringing many serious charges they could not prove Then Paul made his defense I have committed no offense against law Jews or against temple or against Caesar But Festus wishing do Jews favor said Paul you willing go up Jerusalem stand trial before me on these charges Paul replied I am standing before judgment seat Caesar where I ought tried I have done nothing wrong Jews you yourself know very well If however I am guilty anything worthy death I do not refuse die But if there no truth their accusations against me no one has right hand me over them I appeal Caesar Then Festus conferred his council replied You have appealed Caesar Caesar you will go After several days had passed King Agrippa Bernice came down Caesarea pay their respects Festus Since they staying several days Festus laid out Paul case before king There certain man whom Felix left prison While I Jerusalem chief priests elders Jews presented their case requested judgment against him I told them not Roman custom hand man over before he has had opportunity face his accusers defend himself against their charges So when they came here me I did not delay next day I sat on judgment seat ordered man brought But when his accusers rose speak they did not charge him any crimes I had expected They only had some contentions him regarding their own religion certain Jesus who had died but whom Paul affirmed alive Since I loss how investigate these matters I asked if he willing go Jerusalem tried there on these charges But when Paul appealed held over decision Emperor I ordered he held until I could send him Caesar Then Agrippa said Festus I would like hear this man myself Tomorrow you will hear him Festus declared next day Agrippa Bernice came great pomp entered auditorium along commanders leading men city Festus ordered Paul brought Then Festus said King Agrippa all who present us you see this man whole Jewish community has petitioned me about him both here Jerusalem crying out he ought not live any longer But I found he had done nothing worthy death since he has now appealed Emperor I decided send him I have nothing definite write our sovereign one about him Therefore I have brought him before all you especially before you King Agrippa so after this inquiry I may have something write seems unreasonable me send on prisoner without specifying charges against him Agrippa said Paul You have permission speak yourself Then Paul stretched out his hand began his defense King Agrippa I consider myself fortunate stand before you today defend myself against all accusations Jews especially since you acquainted all Jewish customs controversies I beg you therefore listen me patiently Surely all Jews know how I have lived from earliest days my youth among my own people Jerusalem They have known me long time can testify if they willing I lived Pharisee adhering strictest sect our religion now I stand on trial because my hope promise God made our fathers promise our twelve tribes hoping realize they earnestly serve God day night because this hope O king I am accused by Jews Why would any you consider incredible God raises dead So then I too convinced I ought do all I could oppose name Jesus Nazareth what I did Jerusalem authority from chief priests I put many saints prison when they condemned death I cast my vote against them I frequently had them punished synagogues I tried make them blaspheme my raging fury against them I even went foreign cities persecute them this pursuit I on my way Damascus authority commission chief priests About noon O king I on road I saw light from heaven brighter than sun shining around me my companions We all fell ground I heard voice say me Hebrew Saul Saul why do you persecute Me hard you kick against goads Who You Lord I asked I am Jesus whom you persecuting Lord replied But get up stand on your feet I have appeared you appoint you servant witness what you have seen from Me what I will show you I will rescue you from your own people from Gentiles I am sending you them open their eyes so they may turn from darkness light from power Satan God they may receive forgiveness sins inheritance among those sanctified by faith Me So then King Agrippa I not disobedient heavenly vision First those Damascus Jerusalem then everyone region Judea then Gentiles I declared they should repent turn God performing deeds worthy their repentance this reason Jews seized me temple courts tried kill me But I have had God help this day I stand here testify small great alike I am saying nothing beyond what prophets Moses said would happen Christ would suffer first rise from dead would proclaim light our people Gentiles this stage Paul defense Festus exclaimed loud voice You insane Paul Your great learning driving you madness But Paul answered I am not insane most excellent Festus I am speaking words truth sobriety king knows about these matters I can speak freely him I am confident none this has escaped his notice because not done corner King Agrippa do you believe prophets I know you do Then Agrippa said Paul Can you persuade me such short time become Christian Short time or long Paul replied I wish God not only you but all who hear me this day may become what I am except these chains Then king governor rose along Bernice those seated them On their way out they said one another This man has done nothing worthy death or imprisonment Agrippa said Festus This man could have been released if he had not appealed Caesar When decided we would sail Italy Paul some other prisoners handed over centurion named Julius who belonged Imperial Regiment We boarded Adramyttian ship about sail ports along coast Asia we put out sea Aristarchus Macedonian from Thessalonica us next day we landed Sidon Julius treated Paul consideration allowing him visit his friends receive their care After putting out from there we sailed lee Cyprus because winds against us when we had sailed across open sea off coast Cilicia Pamphylia we came Myra Lycia There centurion found Alexandrian ship sailing Italy put us on board After sailing slowly many days we arrived off Cnidus When wind impeded us we sailed lee Crete opposite Salmone After we had moved along coast difficulty we came place called Fair Havens near town Lasea By now much time had passed voyage had already become dangerous because after Fast So Paul advised them Men I can see our voyage will filled disaster great loss not only ship cargo but our own lives well But contrary Paul advice centurion persuaded by pilot by owner ship Since harbor unsuitable winter majority decided sail on if somehow they could reach Phoenix winter there Phoenix harbor Crete facing both southwest northwest When gentle south wind began blow they thought they had their opportunity So they weighed anchor sailed along hugging coast Crete But not long before cyclone called Northeaster swept down across island Unable head into wind ship caught up So we gave way let ourselves driven along Passing lee small island called Cauda we barely managed secure lifeboat After hoisting up crew used ropes undergird ship fearing they would run aground on sandbars Syrtis they lowered sea anchor driven along We tossed so violently next day men began jettison cargo On third day they threw ship tackle overboard their own hands When neither sun nor stars appeared many days great storm continued batter us we abandoned all hope being saved After men had gone long time without food Paul stood up among them said Men you should have followed my advice not sail from Crete Then you would have averted this disaster loss But now I urge you keep up your courage because you will not experience any loss life but only ship just last night angel God whose I am whom I serve stood beside me said Do not afraid Paul you must stand before Caesar look God has granted you lives all who sail you So take courage men I believe God will happen just He told me However we must run aground on some island On fourteenth night we still being driven across Adriatic Sea About midnight sailors sensed they approaching land They took soundings found water twenty fathoms deep Going little farther they took another set soundings read fifteen fathoms Fearing we would run aground on rocks they dropped four anchors from stern prayed daybreak Meanwhile sailors attempted escape from ship Pretending lower anchors from bow they let lifeboat down into sea But Paul said centurion soldiers Unless these men remain ship you cannot saved So soldiers cut ropes lifeboat set adrift Right up daybreak Paul kept urging them all eat Today your fourteenth day constant suspense without taking any food So your own preservation I urge you eat something because not single hair your head will lost After he had said this Paul took bread gave thanks God front them all Then he broke began eat They all encouraged took some food themselves all there 276 us on board After men had eaten their fill they lightened ship by throwing grain into sea When daylight came they did not recognize land but they sighted bay sandy beach where they decided run ship aground if they could Cutting away anchors they left them sea they loosened ropes held rudders Then they hoisted foresail wind made beach But vessel struck sandbar ran aground bow stuck fast would not move stern being broken up by pounding waves soldiers planned kill prisoners so none them could swim freedom But centurion wanting spare Paul life thwarted their plan He commanded those who could swim jump overboard first get land rest follow on planks various parts ship this way everyone brought safely land Once we safely ashore we learned island called Malta islanders showed us extraordinary kindness They kindled fire welcomed all us because raining cold Paul gathered bundle sticks he laid them on fire viper driven out by heat fastened itself his hand When islanders saw creature hanging from his hand they said one another Surely this man murderer Although he saved from sea Justice has not allowed him live But Paul shook creature off into fire suffered no ill effects islanders expecting him swell up or suddenly drop dead But after waiting long time seeing nothing unusual happen him they changed their minds said he god Nearby stood estate belonging Publius chief official island He welcomed us entertained us hospitably three days father Publius sick bed suffering from fever dysentery Paul went see him after praying placing his hands on him he healed man After this had happened rest sick on island came cured well islanders honored us many ways supplied our needs when we ready sail After three months we set sail Alexandrian ship had wintered island had Twin Brothers figurehead Putting Syracuse we stayed there three days From there we weighed anchor came Rhegium After one day south wind came up on second day we arrived Puteoli There we found some brothers who invited us spend week them so we came Rome brothers there had heard about us traveled far Forum Appius Three Taverns meet us When Paul saw them he encouraged gave thanks God When we arrived Rome Paul permitted stay by himself soldier guard him After three days he called together leaders Jews When they had gathered he said them Brothers although I have done nothing against our people or customs our fathers I taken prisoner Jerusalem handed over Romans They examined me wanted release me because there no basis death sentence against me But when Jews objected I compelled appeal Caesar even though I have no charge bring against my nation So this reason I have called see you speak you because hope Israel I am bound this chain leaders replied We have not received any letters about you from Judea nor have any brothers from there reported or even mentioned anything bad about you But we consider your views worth hearing because we know people everywhere speaking against this sect So they set day meet Paul many people came place he staying He expounded them from morning evening testifying about kingdom God persuading them about Jesus from Law Moses Prophets Some them convinced by what he said but others refused believe They disagreed among themselves began leave after Paul had made this final statement Holy Spirit right when He spoke your fathers through Isaiah prophet Go this people say You will ever hearing but never understanding you will ever seeing but never perceiving this people heart has grown callous they hardly hear their ears they have closed their eyes Otherwise they might see their eyes hear their ears understand their hearts turn I would heal them advised therefore God salvation has been sent Gentiles they will listen Romans 1 Unashamed Gospel Paul servant Christ Jesus called apostle set apart gospel God gospel He promised beforehand through His prophets Holy Scriptures regarding His Son who descendant David according flesh who through Spirit holiness declared power Son God by His resurrection from dead Jesus Christ our Lord Through Him on behalf His name we received grace apostleship call all those among Gentiles obedience comes from faith you also among those who called belong Jesus Christ all Rome who loved by God called saints Grace peace you from God our Father Lord Jesus Christ First I thank my God through Jesus Christ all you because your faith being proclaimed all over world God whom I serve my spirit preaching gospel His Son my witness how constantly I remember you my prayers all times asking now last by God will I may succeed coming you I long see you so I may impart you some spiritual gift strengthen you you I may mutually encouraged by each other faith I do not want you unaware brothers how often I planned come you but have been prevented from visiting until now order I might have harvest among you just I have had among other Gentiles I am obligated both Greeks non Greeks both wise foolish why I am so eager preach gospel also you who Rome I am not ashamed gospel because power God salvation everyone who believes first Jew then Greek gospel reveals righteousness God comes by faith from start finish just written righteous will live by faith wrath God being revealed from heaven against all godlessness wickedness men who suppress truth by their wickedness what may known about God plain them because God has made plain them since creation world God invisible qualities His eternal power divine nature have been clearly seen being understood from His workmanship so men without excuse although they knew God they neither glorified Him God nor gave thanks Him but they became futile their thinking darkened their foolish hearts Although they claimed wise they became fools exchanged glory immortal God images mortal man birds animals reptiles Therefore God gave them over desires their hearts impurity dishonoring their bodies one another They exchanged truth God lie worshiped served creature rather than Creator who forever worthy praise Amen this reason God gave them over dishonorable passions Even their women exchanged natural relations unnatural ones Likewise men abandoned natural relations women burned lust one another Men committed indecent acts other men received themselves due penalty their error Furthermore since they did not see fit acknowledge God He gave them up depraved mind do what ought not done They have become filled every kind wickedness evil greed depravity They full envy murder strife deceit malice They gossips slanderers God haters insolent arrogant boastful They invent new forms evil they disobey their parents They senseless faithless heartless merciless Although they know God righteous decree those who do such things worthy death they not only continue do these things but also approve those who practice them You therefore have no excuse you who pass judgment on another on whatever grounds you judge other you condemning yourself because you who pass judgment do same things we know God judgment against those who do such things based on truth So when you O man pass judgment on others yet do same things do you think you will escape God judgment Or do you disregard riches His kindness tolerance patience not realizing God kindness leads you repentance But because your hard unrepentant heart you storing up wrath against yourself day wrath when God righteous judgment will revealed God will repay each one according his deeds those who by perseverance doing good seek glory honor immortality He will give eternal life But those who self seeking who reject truth follow wickedness there will wrath anger There will trouble distress every human being who does evil first Jew then Greek but glory honor peace everyone who does good first Jew then Greek God does not show favoritism All who sin apart from law will also perish apart from law all who sin under law will judged by law not hearers law who righteous before God but doers law who will declared righteous Indeed when Gentiles who do not have law do by nature what law requires they law themselves even though they do not have law So they show work law written on their hearts their consciences also bearing witness their thoughts either accusing or defending them on day when God will judge men secrets through Christ Jesus proclaimed by my gospel Now you if you call yourself Jew if you rely on law boast God if you know His will approve what superior because you instructed by law if you convinced you guide blind light those darkness instructor foolish teacher infants because you have law embodiment knowledge truth you then who teach others do you not teach yourself You who preach against stealing do you steal You who forbid adultery do you commit adultery You who abhor idols do you rob temples You who boast law do you dishonor God by breaking law written God name blasphemed among Gentiles because you Circumcision has value if you observe law but if you break law your circumcision has become uncircumcision If man who not circumcised keeps requirements law will not his uncircumcision regarded circumcision one who physically uncircumcised yet keeps law will condemn you who even though you have written code circumcision lawbreaker man not Jew because he one outwardly nor circumcision only outward physical No man Jew because he one inwardly circumcision matter heart by Spirit not by written code Such man praise does not come from men but from God What then advantage being Jew Or what value circumcision Much every way First all they have been entrusted very words God What if some did not have faith Will their lack faith nullify God faithfulness Certainly not Let God true every man liar written So You may proved right when You speak victorious when You judge But if our unrighteousness highlights righteousness God what shall we say God unjust inflict His wrath on us I am speaking human terms Certainly not case how could God judge world However if my falsehood accentuates God truthfulness increase His glory why am I still condemned sinner Why not say some slanderously claim we say Let us do evil good may result Their condemnation deserved What then we any better Not all we have already made charge Jews Greeks alike all under sin written There no one righteous not even one There no one who understands no one who seeks God All have turned away they have together become worthless there no one who does good not even one Their throats open graves their tongues practice deceit venom vipers on their lips Their mouths full cursing bitterness Their feet swift shed blood ruin misery lie their wake way peace they have not known There no fear God before their eyes Now we know whatever law says says those who under law so every mouth may silenced whole world held accountable God Therefore no one will justified His sight by works law law merely brings awareness sin But now apart from law righteousness God has been revealed attested by Law Prophets this righteousness from God comes through faith Jesus Christ all who believe There no distinction all have sinned fall short glory God justified freely by His grace through redemption Christ Jesus God presented Him atoning sacrifice through faith His blood order demonstrate His righteousness because His forbearance He had passed over sins committed beforehand He did this demonstrate His righteousness present time so just justify one who has faith Jesus Where then boasting excluded On what principle On works No but on faith we maintain man justified by faith apart from works law God God Jews only He not God Gentiles too Yes Gentiles too since there only one God who will justify circumcised by faith uncircumcised through same faith Do we then nullify law by this faith Certainly not Instead we uphold law What then shall we say Abraham our forefather has discovered If Abraham indeed justified by works he had something boast about but not before God what does Scripture say Abraham believed God credited him righteousness Now wages worker not credited gift but obligation However one who does not work but believes Him who justifies wicked his faith credited righteousness David speaks likewise blessedness man whom God credits righteousness apart from works Blessed they whose lawless acts forgiven whose sins covered Blessed man whose sin Lord will never count against him this blessing only on circumcised or also on uncircumcised We have been saying Abraham faith credited him righteousness what context credited after his circumcision or before not after but before he received sign circumcision seal righteousness he had by faith while he still uncircumcised So then he father all who believe but not circumcised order righteousness might credited them he also father circumcised who not only circumcised but who also walk footsteps faith our father Abraham had before he circumcised promise Abraham his offspring he would heir world not given through law but through righteousness comes by faith if those who live by law heirs faith useless promise worthless because law brings wrath where there no law there no transgression Therefore promise comes by faith so may rest on grace may guaranteed all Abraham offspring not only those who law but also those who faith Abraham He father us all written I have made you father many nations He our father presence God whom he believed God who gives life dead calls into being what does not yet exist Against all hope Abraham hope believed so became father many nations just he had been told So shall your offspring Without weakening his faith he acknowledged decrepitness his body since he about hundred years old lifelessness Sarah womb Yet he did not waver through disbelief promise God but strengthened his faith gave glory God being fully persuaded God able do what He had promised This why credited him righteousness Now words credited him written not only Abraham but also us whom righteousness will credited us who believe Him who raised Jesus our Lord from dead He delivered over death our trespasses raised life our justification Therefore since we have been justified through faith we have peace God through our Lord Jesus Christ through whom we have gained access by faith into this grace which we stand we rejoice hope glory God Not only but we also rejoice our sufferings because we know suffering produces perseverance perseverance character character hope hope does not disappoint us because God has poured out His love into our hearts through Holy Spirit whom He has given us just right time while we still powerless Christ died ungodly Very rarely will anyone die righteous man though good man someone might possibly dare die But God proves His love us this While we still sinners Christ died us Therefore since we have now been justified by His blood how much more shall we saved from wrath through Him if when we enemies God we reconciled Him through death His Son how much more having been reconciled shall we saved through His life Not only but we also rejoice God through our Lord Jesus Christ through whom we have now received reconciliation Therefore just sin entered world through one man death through sin so also death passed on all men because all sinned sin world before law given but sin not taken into account when there no law Nevertheless death reigned from Adam until Moses even over those who did not sin way Adam transgressed He pattern One come But gift not like trespass if many died by trespass one man how much more did God grace gift came by grace one man Jesus Christ abound many Again gift not like result one man sin judgment followed one sin brought condemnation but gift followed many trespasses brought justification if by trespass one man death reigned through one man how much more will those who receive abundance grace gift righteousness reign life through one man Jesus Christ So then just one trespass brought condemnation all men so also one act righteousness brought justification life all men just through disobedience one man many made sinners so also through obedience one man many will made righteous law came so trespass would increase but where sin increased grace increased all more so just sin reigned death so also grace might reign through righteousness bring eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord What then shall we say Shall we continue sin so grace may increase Certainly not How can we who died sin live any longer Or arent you aware all us who baptized into Christ Jesus baptized into His death We therefore buried Him through baptism into death order just Christ raised from dead through glory Father we too may walk newness life if we have been united Him like this His death we will certainly also united Him His resurrection We know our old self crucified Him so body sin might rendered powerless we should no longer slaves sin anyone who has died has been freed from sin Now if we died Christ we believe we will also live Him we know since Christ raised from dead He cannot die again death no longer has dominion over Him death He died He died sin once all but life He lives He lives God So you too must count yourselves dead sin but alive God Christ Jesus Therefore do not let sin reign your mortal body so you obey its desires Do not present parts your body sin instruments wickedness but present yourselves God those who have been brought from death life present parts your body Him instruments righteousness sin shall not your master because you not under law but under grace What then Shall we sin because we not under law but under grace Certainly not Do you not know when you offer yourselves obedient slaves you slaves one you obey whether you slaves sin leading death or obedience leading righteousness But thanks God though you once slaves sin you wholeheartedly obeyed form teaching which you committed You have been set free from sin have become slaves righteousness I am speaking human terms because weakness your flesh Just you used offer parts your body slavery impurity escalating wickedness so now offer them slavery righteousness leading holiness when you slaves sin you free obligation righteousness What fruit did you reap time from things which you now ashamed outcome those things death But now you have been set free from sin have become slaves God fruit you reap leads holiness outcome eternal life wages sin death but gift God eternal life Christ Jesus our Lord Do you not know brothers I am speaking those who know law law has authority over man only long he lives instance married woman bound by law her husband long he lives But if her husband dies she released from law marriage So then if she joined another man while her husband still alive she called adulteress but if her husband dies she free from law not adulteress even if she marries another man Therefore my brothers you also died law through body Christ you might belong another Him who raised from dead order we might bear fruit God when we lived according flesh sinful passions aroused by law work our bodies bearing fruit death But now having died what bound us we have been released from law so we serve new way Spirit not old way written code What then shall we say law sin Certainly not Indeed I would not have been mindful sin if not law I would not have been aware coveting if law had not said Do not covet But sin seizing its opportunity through commandment produced me every kind covetous desire apart from law sin dead Once I alive apart from law but when commandment came sin sprang life I died So I discovered very commandment meant bring life actually brought death sin seizing its opportunity through commandment deceived me through commandment put me death So then law holy commandment holy righteous good Did which good then become death me Certainly not But order sin might exposed sin produced death me through what good so through commandment sin might become utterly sinful We know law spiritual but I am unspiritual sold slave sin I do not understand what I do what I want do I do not do But what I hate I do if I do what I do not want do I admit law good case no longer I who do but sin living me does I know nothing good lives me my flesh I have desire do what good but I cannot carry out I do not do good I want do Instead I keep on doing evil I do not want do if I do what I do not want no longer I who do but sin living me does So this principle I have discovered When I want do good evil right there me my inner being I delight God law But I see another law work my body warring against law my mind holding me captive law sin dwells within me What wretched man I am Who will rescue me from this body death Thanks God through Jesus Christ our Lord So then my mind I serve law God but my flesh I serve law sin Therefore there now no condemnation those who Christ Jesus Christ Jesus law Spirit life set you free from law sin death what law powerless do weakened by flesh God did by sending His own Son likeness sinful man offering sin He thus condemned sin flesh so righteous standard law might fulfilled us who do not walk according flesh but according Spirit Those who live according flesh set their minds on things flesh but those who live according Spirit set their minds on things Spirit mind flesh death but mind Spirit life peace because mind flesh hostile God does not submit God law nor can do so Those controlled by flesh cannot please God You however controlled not by flesh but by Spirit if Spirit God lives you if anyone does not have Spirit Christ he does not belong Christ But if Christ you your body dead because sin yet your spirit alive because righteousness if Spirit Him who raised Jesus from dead living you He who raised Christ Jesus from dead will also give life your mortal bodies through His Spirit who lives you Therefore brothers we have obligation but not flesh live according if you live according flesh you will die but if by Spirit you put death deeds body you will live all who led by Spirit God sons God you did not receive spirit slavery returns you fear but you received Spirit sonship by whom we cry Abba Father Spirit Himself testifies our spirit we God children if we children then we heirs heirs God co heirs Christ if indeed we suffer Him so we may also glorified Him I consider our present sufferings not comparable glory will revealed us creation waits eager expectation revelation sons God creation subjected futility not by its own will but because One who subjected hope creation itself will set free from its bondage decay brought into glorious freedom children God We know whole creation has been groaning together pains childbirth until present time Not only but we ourselves who have firstfruits Spirit groan inwardly we wait eagerly our adoption sons redemption our bodies this hope we saved but hope seen no hope all Who hopes what he can already see But if we hope what we do not yet see we wait patiently same way Spirit helps us our weakness we do not know how we ought pray but Spirit Himself intercedes us groans too deep words He who searches our hearts knows mind Spirit because Spirit intercedes saints according will God we know God works all things together good those who love Him who called according His purpose those God foreknew He also predestined conformed image His Son so He would firstborn among many brothers those He predestined He also called those He called He also justified those He justified He also glorified What then shall we say response these things If God us who can against us He who did not spare His own Son but gave Him up us all how will He not also along Him freely give us all things Who will bring any charge against God elect God who justifies Who there condemn us Christ Jesus who died more than raised life right hand God He interceding us Who shall separate us from love Christ Shall trouble or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword written Your sake we face death all day long we considered sheep slaughtered No all these things we more than conquerors through Him who loved us I am convinced neither death nor life neither angels nor principalities neither present nor future nor any powers neither height nor depth nor anything else all creation will able separate us from love God Christ Jesus our Lord I speak truth Christ I am not lying confirmed by my conscience Holy Spirit I have deep sorrow unceasing anguish my heart I could wish I myself cursed cut off from Christ sake my brothers my own flesh blood people Israel Theirs adoption sons theirs divine glory covenants theirs giving law temple worship promises Theirs patriarchs from them proceeds human descent Christ who God over all forever worthy praise Amen not though God word has failed not all who descended from Israel Israel Nor because they Abraham descendants they all his children On contrary Through Isaac your offspring will reckoned So not children flesh who God children but children promise who regarded offspring this what promise stated appointed time I will return Sarah will have son Not only but Rebecca children conceived by one man our father Isaac Yet before twins born or had done anything good or bad order God plan election might stand not by works but by Him who calls she told older will serve younger So written Jacob I loved but Esau I hated What then shall we say God unjust Certainly not He says Moses I will have mercy on whom I have mercy I will have compassion on whom I have compassion So then does not depend on man desire or effort but on God mercy Scripture says Pharaoh I raised you up this very purpose I might display My power you My name might proclaimed all earth Therefore God has mercy on whom He wants have mercy He hardens whom He wants harden One you will say me Then why does God still find fault who can resist His will But who you O man talk back God Shall what formed say Him who formed Why did You make me like this Does not potter have right make from same lump clay one vessel special occasions another common use What if God intending show His wrath make His power known bore great patience vessels His wrath prepared destruction What if He did this make riches His glory known vessels His mercy whom He prepared advance glory including us whom He has called not only from Jews but also from Gentiles He says Hosea I will call them My People who not My people I will call her My Beloved who not My beloved will happen very place where said them You not My people they will called sons living God Isaiah cries out concerning Israel Though number Israelites like sand sea only remnant will saved Lord will carry out His sentence on earth thoroughly decisively just Isaiah foretold Unless Lord Hosts had left us descendants we would have become like Sodom we would have resembled Gomorrah What then will we say Gentiles who did not pursue righteousness have obtained righteousness by faith but Israel who pursued law righteousness has not attained Why not Because their pursuit not by faith but if by works They stumbled over stumbling stone written See I lay Zion stone stumbling rock offense one who believes Him will never put shame Brothers my heart desire prayer God Israelites their salvation I testify about them they zealous God but not on basis knowledge Because they ignorant God righteousness sought establish their own they did not submit God righteousness Christ end law bring righteousness everyone who believes concerning righteousness by law Moses writes man who does these things will live by them But righteousness by faith says Do not say your heart Who will ascend into heaven bring Christ down or Who will descend into Abyss bring Christ up from dead But what does say word near you your mouth your heart word faith we proclaiming if you confess your mouth Jesus Lord believe your heart God raised Him from dead you will saved your heart you believe justified your mouth you confess saved just Scripture says Anyone who believes Him will never put shame there no difference between Jew Greek same Lord Lord all gives richly all who call on Him Everyone who calls on name Lord will saved How then can they call on One whom they have not believed how can they believe One whom they have not heard how can they hear without someone preach how can they preach unless they sent written How beautiful feet those who bring good news But not all them welcomed good news Isaiah says Lord who has believed our message Consequently faith comes by hearing hearing by word Christ But I ask did they not hear Indeed they did Their voice has gone out into all earth their words ends world I ask instead did Israel not understand First Moses says I will make you jealous by those who not nation I will make you angry by nation without understanding Isaiah boldly says I found by those who did not seek Me I revealed Myself those who did not ask Me But Israel he says All day long I have held out My hands disobedient obstinate people I ask then did God reject His people Certainly not I am Israelite myself descendant Abraham from tribe Benjamin God did not reject His people whom He foreknew Do you not know what Scripture says about Elijah how he appealed God against Israel Lord they have killed Your prophets torn down Your altars I am only one left they seeking my life well what divine reply him I have reserved Myself seven thousand men who have not bowed knee Baal same way present time there remnant chosen by grace if by grace then no longer by works Otherwise grace would no longer grace What then What Israel seeking failed obtain but elect did others hardened written God gave them spirit stupor eyes could not see ears could not hear this very day David says May their table become snare trap stumbling block retribution them May their eyes darkened so they cannot see their backs bent forever I ask then did they stumble so fall beyond recovery Certainly not However because their trespass salvation has come Gentiles make Israel jealous But if their trespass means riches world their failure means riches Gentiles how much greater riches will their fullness bring I am speaking you Gentiles Inasmuch I am apostle Gentiles I magnify my ministry hope I may provoke my own people jealousy save some them if their rejection reconciliation world what will their acceptance but life from dead If first part dough holy so whole batch if root holy so branches Now if some branches have been broken off you wild olive shoot have been grafted among others share nourishment olive root do not boast over those branches If you do remember this You do not support root but root supports you You will say then Branches broken off so I could grafted correct They broken off because unbelief but you stand by faith Do not arrogant but afraid if God did not spare natural branches He will certainly not spare you either Take notice therefore kindness severity God severity those who fell but kindness you if you continue His kindness Otherwise you also will cut off if they do not persist unbelief they will grafted God able graft them again if you cut from wild olive tree contrary nature grafted into one cultivated how much more readily will these natural branches grafted into their own olive tree I do not want you ignorant this mystery brothers so you will not conceited hardening part has come Israel until full number Gentiles has come so all Israel will saved written Deliverer will come from Zion He will remove godlessness from Jacob this My covenant them when I take away their sins Regarding gospel they enemies on your account but regarding election they loved on account patriarchs God gifts His call irrevocable Just you who formerly disobeyed God have now received mercy through their disobedience so they too have now disobeyed order they too may now receive mercy through mercy shown you God has consigned everyone disobedience so He may have mercy on everyone O depth riches wisdom knowledge God How unsearchable His judgments untraceable His ways Who has known mind Lord Or who has been His counselor Who has first given God God should repay him from Him through Him Him all things Him glory forever Amen Therefore I urge you brothers on account God mercy offer your bodies living sacrifices holy pleasing God which your spiritual service worship Do not conformed this world but transformed by renewing your mind Then you will able test approve what good pleasing perfect will God by grace given me I say every one you Do not think yourself more highly than you ought but think yourself sober judgment according measure faith God has given you Just each us has one body many members not all members have same function so Christ we who many one body each member belongs one another We have different gifts according grace given us If one gift prophecy let him use proportion his faith if serving let him serve if teaching let him teach if encouraging let him encourage if giving let him give generously if leading let him lead diligence if showing mercy let him do cheerfully Love must sincere Detest what evil cling what good devoted one another brotherly love Outdo yourselves honoring one another Do not let your zeal subside keep your spiritual fervor serving Lord joyful hope patient affliction persistent prayer Share saints who need Practice hospitality Bless those who persecute you Bless do not curse Rejoice those who rejoice weep those who weep Live harmony one another Do not proud but enjoy company lowly Do not conceited Do not repay anyone evil evil Carefully consider what right eyes everybody If possible on your part live peace everyone Do not avenge yourselves beloved but leave room God wrath written Vengeance Mine I will repay says Lord On contrary If your enemy hungry feed him if he thirsty give him drink so doing you will heap burning coals on his head Do not overcome by evil but overcome evil good Everyone must submit himself governing authorities there no authority except which from God authorities exist have been appointed by God Consequently whoever resists authority opposing what God has set place those who do so will bring judgment on themselves rulers not terror good conduct but bad Do you want unafraid one authority Then do what right you will have his approval he God servant your good But if you do wrong afraid he does not carry sword vain He God servant agent retribution wrongdoer Therefore necessary submit authority not only avoid punishment but also matter conscience This also why you pay taxes authorities God servants who devote themselves their work Pay everyone what you owe him taxes whom taxes due revenue whom revenue due respect whom respect due honor whom honor due indebted no one except one another love he who loves his neighbor has fulfilled law commandments Do not commit adultery Do not murder Do not steal Do not covet any other commandments summed up this one decree Love your neighbor yourself Love does no wrong its neighbor Therefore love fulfillment law do this understanding occasion hour has come you wake up from your slumber our salvation nearer now than when we first believed night nearly over day has drawn near So let us lay aside deeds darkness put on armor light Let us behave decently daytime not carousing drunkenness not sexual immorality debauchery not dissension jealousy Instead clothe yourselves Lord Jesus Christ make no provision desires flesh Accept him whose faith weak without passing judgment on his opinions one person has faith eat all things while another who weak eats only vegetables one who eats everything must not belittle one who does not one who does not eat everything must not judge one who does God has accepted him Who you judge someone else servant his own master he stands or falls he will stand Lord able make him stand One person regards certain day above others while someone else considers every day alike Each one should fully convinced his own mind He who observes special day does so Lord he who eats does so Lord he gives thanks God he who abstains does so Lord gives thanks God none us lives himself alone none us dies himself alone If we live we live Lord if we die we die Lord So whether we live or die we belong Lord this reason Christ died returned life He might Lord both dead living Why then do you judge your brother Or why do you belittle your brother we will all stand before God judgment seat written surely I live says Lord every knee will bow before Me every tongue will confess God So then each us will give account himself God Therefore let us stop judging one another Instead make up your mind not put any stumbling block or obstacle your brother way I am convinced fully persuaded Lord Jesus nothing unclean itself But if anyone regards something unclean then him unclean If your brother distressed by what you eat you no longer acting love Do not by your eating destroy your brother whom Christ died Do not allow what you consider good then spoken evil kingdom

destroy work God sake food All food clean but wrong man let his eating stumbling block better not eat meat or drink wine or do anything cause your brother stumble Keep your belief about such matters between yourself God Blessed one who does not condemn himself by what he approves But one who has doubts condemned if he eats because his eating not from faith everything not from faith sin We who strong ought bear shortcomings weak not please ourselves Each us should please his neighbor his good build him up even Christ did not please Himself but written insults those who insult You have

household have informed me there quarrels among you What I mean this Individuals among you saying I follow Paul I follow Apollos I follow Cephas or I follow Christ Christ divided Paul crucified you you baptized into name Paul I thank God I did not baptize any you except Crispus Gaius so no one can say you baptized into my name Yes I also baptized household Stephanas beyond I do not remember if I baptized anyone else Christ did not send me baptize but preach gospel not words wisdom lest cross Christ emptied its power message cross foolishness those who perishing but us who being saved power God written I will destroy wisdom wise intelligence intelligent I will frustrate Where wise man Where scribe Where philosopher this age Has not God made foolish wisdom world since wisdom God world through its wisdom did not know Him God pleased through foolishness what preached save those who believe Jews demand signs Greeks search wisdom but we preach Christ crucified stumbling block Jews foolishness Gentiles but those who called both Jews Greeks Christ power God wisdom God foolishness God wiser than man wisdom weakness God stronger than man strength Brothers consider time your calling Not many you wise by human standards not many powerful not many noble birth But God chose foolish things world shame wise God chose weak things world shame strong He chose lowly despised things world things not nullify things so no one may boast His presence because Him you Christ Jesus who has become us wisdom from God our righteousness holiness redemption Therefore written Let him who boasts boast Lord When I came you brothers I did not come eloquence or wisdom I proclaimed you testimony about God I resolved know nothing while I you except Jesus Christ Him crucified I came you weakness fear much trembling My message my preaching not persuasive words wisdom but demonstration Spirit power so your faith would not rest on men wisdom but on God power Among mature however we speak message wisdom but not wisdom this age or rulers this age who coming nothing No we speak mysterious hidden wisdom God which He destined our glory before time began None rulers this age understood if they had they would not have crucified Lord glory Rather written No eye has seen no ear has heard no heart has imagined what God has prepared those who love Him But God has revealed us by Spirit Spirit searches all things even deep things God who among men knows thoughts man except his own spirit within him So too no one knows thoughts God except Spirit God We have not received spirit world but Spirit who from God we may understand what God has freely given us this what we speak not words taught us by human wisdom but words taught by Spirit expressing spiritual truths spiritual words natural man does not accept things come from Spirit God they foolishness him he cannot understand them because they spiritually discerned spiritual man judges all things but he himself not subject anyone judgment who has known mind Lord so instruct Him But we have mind Christ Brothers I could not address you spiritual but worldly infants Christ I gave you milk not solid food you not yet ready solid food fact you still not ready you still worldly since there jealousy dissension among you you not worldly you not walking way man when one you says I follow Paul another I follow Apollos you not mere men What then Apollos what Paul They servants through whom you believed Lord has assigned each his role I planted seed Apollos watered but God made grow So neither he who plants nor he who waters anything but only God who makes things grow He who plants he who waters one purpose each will rewarded according his own labor we God fellow workers you God field God building By grace God has given me I laid foundation expert builder someone else building on But each one must careful how he builds no one can lay foundation other than one already laid which Jesus Christ If anyone builds on this foundation using gold silver precious stones wood hay or straw his workmanship will evident because Day will bring light will revealed fire fire will prove quality each man work If what he has built survives he will receive reward If burned up he will suffer loss He himself will saved but only if through flames Do you not know you yourselves God temple God Spirit dwells you If anyone destroys God temple God will destroy him God temple holy you temple Let no one deceive himself If any you thinks he wise this age he should become fool so he may become wise wisdom this world foolishness God sight written He catches wise their craftiness again Lord knows thoughts wise futile Therefore stop boasting men All things yours whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or world or life or death or present or future All them belong you you belong Christ Christ belongs God So then men ought regard us servants Christ stewards mysteries God Now required stewards they found faithful I care very little however if I am judged by you or by any human court fact I do not even judge myself My conscience clear but does not vindicate me Lord who judges me Therefore judge nothing before appointed time wait until Lord comes He will bring light what hidden darkness will expose motives men hearts time each will receive his praise from God Brothers I have applied these things myself Apollos your benefit so you may learn from us not go beyond what written Then you will not take pride one man over another who makes you so superior What do you have you did not receive if you did receive why do you boast though you did not Already you have all you want Already you have become rich Without us you have become kings How I wish you really kings so we might kings you seems me God has displayed us apostles end procession like prisoners appointed death We have become spectacle whole world angels well men We fools Christ but you wise Christ We weak but you strong You honored but we dishonored this very hour we hungry thirsty we poorly clothed we brutally treated we homeless We work hard our own hands When we vilified we bless when we persecuted we endure when we slandered we answer gently Up this moment we have become scum earth refuse world I am not writing this shame you but warn you my beloved children Even if you have ten thousand guardians Christ you do not have many fathers Christ Jesus I became your father through gospel Therefore I urge you imitate me why I have sent you Timothy my beloved faithful child Lord He will remind you my way life Christ Jesus which exactly what I teach everywhere every church Some you have become arrogant if I not coming you But I will come you shortly if Lord willing then I will find out not only what these arrogant people saying but what power they have kingdom God not matter talk but power Which do you prefer Shall I come you rod or love gentle spirit actually reported there sexual immorality among you kind intolerable even among pagans man has his father wife you proud Shouldnt you rather have been stricken grief have removed from your fellowship man who did this Although I am absent from you body I am present you spirit I have already pronounced judgment on one who did this just if I present When you assembled name our Lord Jesus I am you spirit along power Lord Jesus hand this man over Satan destruction flesh so his spirit may saved on Day Lord Your boasting not good Do you not know little leaven works through whole batch dough Get rid old leaven you may new unleavened batch you really Christ our Passover lamb has been sacrificed Therefore let us keep feast not old bread leavened malice wickedness but unleavened bread sincerity truth I wrote you my letter not associate sexually immoral people I not including sexually immoral this world or greedy swindlers or idolaters case you would have leave this world But now I am writing you not associate anyone who claims brother but sexually immoral or greedy idolater or verbal abuser drunkard or swindler such man do not even eat What business mine judge those outside church you not judge those inside God will judge those outside Expel wicked man from among you If any you has grievance against another how dare he go law before unrighteous instead before saints Do you not know saints will judge world if you judge world you not competent judge trivial cases Do you not know we will judge angels How much more things this life So if you need settle everyday matters do you appoint judges those no standing church I say this your shame there really no one among you wise enough arbitrate between his brothers Instead one brother goes law against another this front unbelievers very fact you have lawsuits among you means you thoroughly defeated already Why not rather wronged Why not rather cheated Instead you yourselves cheat do wrong even against your own brothers Do you not know wicked will not inherit kingdom God Do not deceived Neither sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor men who submit or perform homosexual acts nor thieves nor greedy nor drunkards nor verbal abusers nor swindlers will inherit kingdom God what some you But you washed you sanctified you justified name Lord Jesus Christ by Spirit our God Everything permissible me but not everything beneficial Everything permissible me but I will not mastered by anything Food stomach stomach food but God will destroy them both body not intended sexual immorality but Lord Lord body By His power God raised Lord from dead He will raise us also Do you not know your bodies members Christ Shall I then take members Christ unite them prostitute Never Or dont you know he who unites himself prostitute one her body said two will become one flesh But he who unites himself Lord one Him spirit Flee from sexual immorality Every other sin man can commit outside his body but he who sins sexually sins against his own body Do you not know your body temple Holy Spirit who you whom you have received from God You not your own you bought price Therefore glorify God your body Now matters you wrote about good abstain from sexual relations But because there so much sexual immorality each man should have his own wife each woman her own husband husband should fulfill his marital duty his wife likewise wife her husband wife does not have authority over her own body but husband Likewise husband does not have authority over his own body but wife Do not deprive each other except by mutual consent time so you may devote yourselves prayer Then come together again so Satan will not tempt you through your lack self control I say this concession not command I wish all men I am But each man has his own gift from God one has this gift another has Now unmarried widows I say this good them remain unmarried I am But if they cannot control themselves let them marry better marry than burn passion married I give this command not I but Lord wife must not separate from her husband But if she does she must remain unmarried or else reconciled her husband husband must not divorce his wife rest I say this I not Lord If brother has unbelieving wife she willing live him he must not divorce her if woman has unbelieving husband he willing live her she must not divorce him unbelieving husband sanctified through his believing wife unbelieving wife sanctified through her believing husband Otherwise your children would unclean but now they holy But if unbeliever leaves let him go believing brother or sister not bound such cases God has called you live peace How do you know wife whether you will save your husband Or how do you know husband whether you will save your wife Regardless each one should lead life Lord has assigned him which God has called him This what I prescribe all churches man already circumcised when he called He should not become uncircumcised man still uncircumcised when called He should not circumcised Circumcision nothing uncircumcision nothing Keeping God commandments what counts Each one should remain situation he when he called you slave when you called Do not let concern you but if you can gain your freedom take opportunity he who slave when he called by Lord Lord freedman Conversely he who free man when he called Christ slave You bought price do not become slaves men Brothers each one should remain situation he when God called him Now about virgins I have no command from Lord but I give judgment one who by Lord mercy trustworthy Because present crisis I think good man remain he you committed wife Do not seek released you free commitment Do not look wife But if you do marry you have not sinned if virgin marries she has not sinned But those who marry will face troubles this life I want spare you this What I am saying brothers time short From now on those who have wives should live if they had none those who weep if they did not those who joyful if they not those who make purchase if they had nothing those who use things this world if not dependent on them this world its present form passing away I want you free from concern unmarried man concerned about work Lord how he can please Lord But married man concerned about affairs this world how he can please his wife his interests divided unmarried woman or virgin concerned about work Lord how she can holy both body spirit But married woman concerned about affairs this world how she can please her husband I am saying this your own good not restrict you but order promote proper decorum undivided devotion Lord However if someone thinks he acting inappropriately toward his betrothed if she beyond her youth they ought marry let him do he wishes he not sinning they should get married But man who firmly established his heart under no constraint control over his will resolve his heart not marry virgin he will do well So then he who marries virgin does well but he who does not marry her does even better wife bound her husband long he lives But if her husband dies she free marry anyone she wishes long he belongs Lord my judgment however she happier if she remains she I think I too have Spirit God Now about food sacrificed idols We know we all have knowledge Knowledge puffs up but love builds up one who thinks he knows something does not yet know he ought know But one who loves God known by God So about eating food sacrificed idols We know idol nothing all world there no God but one even if there so called gods whether heaven or on earth there many so called gods lords yet us there but one God Father from whom all things came whom we exist there but one Lord Jesus Christ through whom all things came through whom we exist But not everyone has this knowledge Some people still so accustomed idols they eat such food if sacrificed idol since their conscience weak defiled But food does not bring us closer God We no worse if we do not eat no better if we do careful however your freedom does not become stumbling block weak if someone weak conscience sees you who well informed eating idol temple will he not encouraged eat food sacrificed idols So this weak brother whom Christ died destroyed by your knowledge By sinning against your brothers this way wounding their weak conscience you sin against Christ Therefore if what I eat causes my brother stumble I will never eat meat again so I will not cause him stumble Am I not free Am I not apostle Have I not seen Jesus our Lord you yourselves not my workmanship Lord Even if I am not apostle others surely I am you you seal my apostleship Lord This my defense those who scrutinize me Have we no right food drink Have we no right take along believing wife do other apostles Lord brothers Cephas Or Barnabas I only apostles who must work living Who serves soldier his own expense Who plants vineyard does not eat its fruit Who tends flock does not drink its milk Do I say this from human perspective Doesnt Law say same thing written Law Moses Do not muzzle ox while treading out grain about oxen God concerned Isnt He actually speaking on our behalf Indeed this written us because when plowman plows thresher threshes they should also expect share harvest If we have sown spiritual seed among you too much us reap material harvest from you If others have this right your support shouldnt we have all more But we did not exercise this right Instead we put up anything rather than hinder gospel Christ Do you not know those who work temple eat its food those who serve altar partake its offerings same way Lord has prescribed those who preach gospel should receive their living from gospel But I have not used any these rights I am not writing this suggest something done me Indeed I would rather die than let anyone nullify my boast Yet when I preach gospel I have no reason boast because I am obligated preach Woe me if I do not preach gospel If my preaching voluntary I have reward But if not voluntary I am still entrusted responsibility What then my reward preaching gospel I may offer free charge so not use up my rights preaching Though I am free obligation anyone I make myself slave everyone win many possible Jews I became like Jew win Jews those under law I became like one under law though I myself am not under law win those under law those without law I became like one without law though I am not outside law God but am under law Christ win those without law weak I became weak win weak I have become all things all people so by all possible means I might save some I do all this sake gospel so I may share its blessings Do you not know race all runners run but only one receives prize Run such way take prize Everyone who competes games trains strict discipline They do crown perishable but we do crown imperishable Therefore I do not run aimlessly I do not fight like I am beating air No I discipline my body make my slave so after I have preached others I myself will not disqualified I do not want you unaware brothers our forefathers all under cloud they all passed through sea They all baptized into Moses cloud sea They all ate same spiritual food drank same spiritual drink they drank from spiritual rock accompanied them rock Christ Nevertheless God not pleased most them they struck down wilderness These things took place examples keep us from craving evil things they did Do not idolaters some them written people sat down eat drink got up indulge revelry We should not commit sexual immorality some them did one day twenty three thousand them died We should not test Christ some them did killed by snakes do not complain some them did killed by destroying angel Now these things happened them examples written down warnings us on whom fulfillment ages has come So one who thinks he standing firm should careful not fall No temptation has seized you except what common man God faithful He will not let you tempted beyond what you can bear But when you tempted He will also provide escape so you can stand up under Therefore my beloved flee from idolatry I speak reasonable people judge yourselves what I say not cup blessing we bless participation blood Christ not bread we break participation body Christ Because there one loaf we who many one body we all partake one loaf Consider people Israel not those who eat sacrifices fellow partakers altar Am I suggesting then food sacrificed idol anything or idol anything No but sacrifices pagans offered demons not God I do not want you participants demons You cannot drink cup Lord cup demons too you cannot partake table Lord table demons too we trying provoke Lord jealousy we stronger than He Everything permissible but not everything beneficial Everything permissible but not everything edifying No one should seek his own good but good others Eat anything sold meat market without raising questions conscience earth Lord fullness thereof If unbeliever invites you meal you want go eat anything set before you without raising questions conscience But if someone tells you This food offered idols then do not eat sake one who told you sake conscience other one conscience I mean not your own why should my freedom determined by someone else conscience If I partake meal thankfulness why am I denounced because which I give thanks So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do do all glory God Do not become stumbling block whether Jews or Greeks or church God I also try please everyone all I do I am not seeking my own good but good many they may saved You imitate me just I imitate Christ Now I commend you remembering me everything maintaining traditions just I passed them on you But I want you understand head every man Christ head woman man head Christ God Every man who prays or prophesies his head covered dishonors his head every woman who prays or prophesies her head uncovered dishonors her head just if her head shaved If woman does not cover her head she should have her hair cut off if shameful woman have her hair cut or shaved off she should cover her head man ought not cover his head since he image glory God but woman glory man man did not come from woman but woman from man Neither man created woman but woman man this reason woman ought have sign authority on her head because angels Lord however woman not independent man nor man independent woman just woman came from man so also man born woman But everything comes from God Judge yourselves proper woman pray God her head uncovered Doesnt nature itself teach you if man has long hair disgrace him but if woman has long hair her glory long hair given her covering If anyone inclined dispute this we have no other practice nor do churches God following instructions I have no praise offer because your gatherings do more harm than good First all I hear when you come together church there divisions among you part I believe indeed there must differences among you show which you approved Now then when you come together not Lord Supper you eat you eat each you goes ahead without sharing his meal While one remains hungry another gets drunk Dont you have your own homes which eat drink Or do you despise church God humiliate those who have nothing What can I say you Shall I praise you this No I will not I received from Lord what I also passed on you Lord Jesus on night He betrayed took bread when He had given thanks He broke said This My body which you do this remembrance Me same way after supper He took cup saying This cup new covenant My blood do this often you drink remembrance Me often you eat this bread drink this cup you proclaim Lord death until He comes Therefore whoever eats bread or drinks cup Lord unworthy manner will guilty sinning against body blood Lord Each one must examine himself before he eats bread drinks cup anyone who eats drinks without recognizing body eats drinks judgment on himself why many among you weak sick number you have fallen asleep Now if we judged ourselves properly we would not come under judgment But when we judged by Lord we being disciplined so we will not condemned world So my brothers when you come together eat wait one another If anyone hungry he should eat home so when you come together will not result judgment when I come I will give instructions about remaining matters Now about spiritual gifts brothers I do not want you uninformed You know when you pagans you influenced led astray mute idols Therefore I inform you no one who speaking by Spirit God says Jesus cursed no one can say Jesus Lord except by Holy Spirit There different gifts but same Spirit There different ministries but same Lord There different ways working but same God works all things all people Now each one manifestation Spirit given common good one there given through Spirit message wisdom another message knowledge by same Spirit another faith by same Spirit another gifts healing by one Spirit another working miracles another prophecy another distinguishing between spirits another speaking various tongues still another interpretation tongues All these work one same Spirit who apportions them each one He determines body unit though composed many parts although its parts many they all form one body So Christ one Spirit we all baptized into one body whether Jews or Greeks slave or free we all given one Spirit drink body does not consist one part but many If foot should say Because I am not hand I do not belong body would not make any less part body if ear should say Because I am not eye I do not belong body would not make any less part body If whole body eye where would sense hearing If whole body ear where would sense smell But fact God has arranged members body every one them according His design If they all one part where would body there many parts but one body eye cannot say hand I do not need you Nor can head say feet I do not need you On contrary parts body seem weaker indispensable parts we consider less honorable we treat greater honor our unpresentable parts treated special modesty whereas our presentable parts have no such need But God has composed body has given greater honor parts lacked so there should no division body but its members should have mutual concern one another If one part suffers every part suffers if one part honored every part rejoices Now you body Christ each you member church God has appointed first all apostles second prophets third teachers then workers miracles those gifts healing helping administration various tongues all apostles all prophets all teachers Do all work miracles Do all have gifts healing Do all speak tongues Do all interpret But eagerly desire greater gifts now I will show you most excellent way If I speak tongues men angels but have not love I am only ringing gong or clanging cymbal If I have gift prophecy can fathom all mysteries all knowledge if I have absolute faith so move mountains but have not love I am nothing If I give all I possess poor exult surrender my body but have not love I gain nothing Love patient love kind does not envy does not boast not proud not rude not self seeking not easily angered keeps no account wrongs Love takes no pleasure evil but rejoices truth bears all things believes all things hopes all things endures all things Love never fails But where there prophecies they will cease where there tongues they will restrained where there knowledge will dismissed we know part we prophesy part but when perfect comes partial passes away When I child I talked like child I thought like child I reasoned like child When I became man I set aside childish ways Now we see but dim reflection mirror then we shall see face face Now I know part then I shall know fully even I am fully known now these three remain faith hope love but greatest these love Earnestly pursue love eagerly desire spiritual gifts especially gift prophecy he who speaks tongue does not speak men but God Indeed no one understands him he utters mysteries Spirit But he who prophesies speaks men their edification encouragement comfort one who speaks tongue edifies himself but one who prophesies edifies church I wish all you could speak tongues but I would rather have you prophesy He who prophesies greater than one who speaks tongues unless he interprets so church may edified Now brothers if I come you speaking tongues how will I benefit you unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or teaching Even case lifeless instruments such flute or harp how will anyone recognize tune they playing unless notes distinct Again if trumpet sounds muffled call who will prepare battle So you Unless you speak intelligible words your tongue how will anyone know what you saying You will just speaking into air Assuredly there many different languages world yet none them without meaning If then I do not know meaning someone language I am foreigner speaker he foreigner me same you Since you eager have spiritual gifts strive excel gifts build up church Therefore one who speaks tongue should pray he may interpret if I pray tongue my spirit prays but my mind unfruitful What then shall I do I will pray my spirit but I will also pray my mind I will sing my spirit but I will also sing my mind Otherwise if you speak blessing spirit how can someone who uninstructed say Amen your thanksgiving since he does not know what you saying You may giving thanks well enough but other one not edified I thank God I speak tongues more than all you But church I would rather speak five coherent words instruct others than ten thousand words tongue Brothers stop thinking like children regard evil infants but your thinking mature written Law By strange tongues foreign lips I will speak this people but even then they will not listen Me says Lord Tongues then sign not believers but unbelievers Prophecy however believers not unbelievers So if whole church comes together everyone speaks tongues some who uninstructed or some unbelievers come will they not say you out your minds But if unbeliever or uninstructed person comes while everyone prophesying he will convicted called account by all secrets his heart will made known So he will fall facedown worship God proclaiming God truly among you What then shall we say brothers When you come together everyone has psalm or teaching revelation tongue or interpretation All these must done build up church If anyone speaks tongue two or most three should speak turn someone must interpret But if there no interpreter he should remain silent church speak only himself God Two or three prophets should speak others should weigh carefully what said if revelation comes someone who seated first speaker should stop you can all prophesy turn so everyone may instructed encouraged spirits prophets subject prophets God not God disorder but peace all churches saints Women silent churches They not permitted speak but must submission law says If they wish inquire about something they ask their own husbands home dishonorable woman speak church Did word God originate you Or you only ones has reached If anyone considers himself prophet or spiritual person let him acknowledge what I am writing you Lord command But if anyone ignores this he himself will ignored So my brothers eager prophesy do not forbid speaking tongues But everything must done proper orderly manner Now brothers I want remind you gospel I preached you which you received which you stand firm By this gospel you saved if you hold firmly word I preached you Otherwise you have believed vain what I received I passed on you first importance Christ died our sins according Scriptures He buried He raised on third day according Scriptures He appeared Cephas then Twelve After He appeared more than five hundred brothers once most whom still living though some have fallen asleep Then He appeared James then all apostles last all He appeared me also one untimely birth I am least apostles am unworthy called apostle because I persecuted church God But by grace God I am what I am His grace me not vain No I worked harder than all them yet not I but grace God me Whether then I or they this what we preach this what you believed But if preached Christ has been raised from dead how can some you say there no resurrection dead If there no resurrection dead then not even Christ has been raised if Christ has not been raised our preaching worthless so your faith case we also exposed false witnesses about God we have testified about God He raised Christ from dead but He did not raise Him if fact dead not raised if dead not raised then not even Christ has been raised if Christ has not been raised your faith futile you still your sins Then those also who have fallen asleep Christ have perished If our hope Christ this life alone we pitied more than all men But Christ has indeed been raised from dead firstfruits those who have fallen asleep since death came through man resurrection dead comes also through man Adam all die so Christ all will made alive But each his own turn Christ firstfruits then His coming those who belong Him Then end will come when He hands over kingdom God Father after He has destroyed all dominion authority power He must reign until He has put all His enemies under His feet last enemy destroyed death God has put everything under His feet Now when says everything has been put under Him this clearly does not include One who put everything under Him when all things have been subjected Him then Son Himself will made subject Him who put all things under Him so God may all all If these things not so what will those do who baptized dead If dead not raised all why people baptized them why do we endanger ourselves every hour I face death every day brothers surely I boast about you Christ Jesus our Lord If I fought wild beasts Ephesus human motives what did I gain If dead not raised Let us eat drink tomorrow we die Do not deceived Bad company corrupts good character Sober up you ought stop sinning some you ignorant God I say this your shame But someone will ask How dead raised what kind body will they come You fool What you sow does not come life unless dies what you sow not body will but just seed perhaps wheat or something else But God gives body He has designed each kind seed He gives its own body Not all flesh same Men have one kind flesh animals have another birds another fish another There also heavenly bodies earthly bodies But splendor heavenly bodies one degree splendor earthly bodies another sun has one degree splendor moon another stars another star differs from star splendor So will resurrection dead What sown perishable raised imperishable sown dishonor raised glory sown weakness raised power sown natural body raised spiritual body If there natural body there also spiritual body So written first man Adam became living being last Adam life giving spirit spiritual however not first but natural then spiritual first man dust earth second man from heaven earthly man so also those who earth heavenly man so also those who heaven just we have borne likeness earthly man so also shall we bear likeness heavenly man Now I declare you brothers flesh blood cannot inherit kingdom God nor does perishable inherit imperishable Listen I tell you mystery We will not all sleep but we will all changed instant twinkling eye last trumpet trumpet will sound dead will raised imperishable we will changed perishable must clothed imperishable mortal immortality When perishable has been clothed imperishable mortal immortality then saying written will come pass Death has been swallowed up victory Where O Death your victory Where O Death your sting sting death sin power sin law But thanks God who gives us victory through our Lord Jesus Christ Therefore my beloved brothers steadfast immovable Always excel work Lord because you know your labor Lord not vain Now about collection saints you do I directed churches Galatia On first day every week each you should set aside portion his income saving up so when I come no collections will needed Then on my arrival I will send letters those you recommend carry your gift Jerusalem if advisable me go also they can travel me After I go through Macedonia however I will come you I will going through Macedonia Perhaps I will stay you awhile or even spend winter so you can help me on my journey wherever I go I do not want see you now

such deadly peril He will deliver us Him we have placed our hope He will yet again deliver us you help us by your prayers Then many will give thanks on our behalf favor shown us answer their prayers this our boast Our conscience testifies we have conducted ourselves world especially relation you holiness sincerity from God not worldly wisdom but grace God we do not write you anything beyond your ability read understand I hope you will understand us completely you have already understood us part so you may boast us just we will boast you day our Lord Jesus Confident this I planned visit you first so you might receive double blessing I wanted visit you on my way Macedonia return you from Macedonia then have you help me on my way Judea When I planned this did I do carelessly Or do I make my plans by human standards so say Yes yes when I really mean No no But surely God faithful our message you not Yes No Son God Jesus Christ who proclaimed among you by me Silvanus Timothy not Yes No but Him has always been Yes all promises God Yes Christ so through Him our Amen spoken glory God Now God who establishes both us you Christ He anointed us placed His seal on us put His Spirit our hearts pledge what come I call God my witness order spare you I did not return Corinth Not we lord over your faith but we fellow workers you your joy because by faith you stand firm So I made up my mind not make another painful visit you if I grieve you who left cheer me but those whom I have grieved I wrote I did so on my arrival I would not saddened by those who ought make me rejoice I had confidence all you you would share my joy through many tears I wrote you out great distress anguish heart not grieve you but let you know how much I love you Now if anyone has caused grief he has not grieved me but all you some degree not overstate punishment imposed on him by majority sufficient him So instead you ought forgive comfort him so he will not overwhelmed by excessive sorrow Therefore I urge you reaffirm your love him My purpose writing you see if you would stand test obedient everything If you forgive anyone I also forgive him if I have forgiven anything I have forgiven presence Christ your sake order Satan should not outwit us we not unaware his schemes Now when I went Troas preach gospel Christ door stood open me Lord I had no peace my spirit because I did not find my brother Titus there So I said goodbye them went on Macedonia But thanks God who always leads us triumphantly captives Christ through us spreads everywhere fragrance knowledge Him we God sweet aroma Christ among those who being saved those who perishing one we odor death demise other fragrance brings life who qualified such task we not like so many others who peddle word God profit On contrary Christ we speak before God sincerity men sent from God we beginning commend ourselves again Or do we need like some people letters recommendation you or from you You yourselves our letter inscribed on our hearts known read by everyone clear you letter from Christ result our ministry written not ink but Spirit living God not on tablets stone but on tablets human hearts Such confidence before God ours through Christ Not we competent ourselves claim anything comes from us but our competence comes from God He has qualified us ministers new covenant not letter but Spirit letter kills but Spirit gives life Now if ministry death which engraved letters on stone came such glory Israelites could not gaze face Moses because its fleeting glory will not ministry Spirit even more glorious if ministry condemnation glorious how much more glorious ministry righteousness Indeed what once glorious has no glory now comparison glory surpasses if what fading away came glory how much greater glory which endures Therefore since we have such hope we very bold We not like Moses who would put veil over his face keep Israelites from gazing end what fading away But their minds closed this day same veil remains reading old covenant has not been lifted because only Christ can removed even this day when Moses read veil covers their hearts But whenever anyone turns Lord veil taken away Now Lord Spirit where Spirit Lord there freedom we who unveiled faces all reflect glory Lord being transformed into His image intensifying glory which comes from Lord who Spirit Therefore since God His mercy has given us this ministry we do not lose heart Instead we have renounced secret shameful ways We do not practice deceit nor do we distort word God On contrary by open proclamation truth we commend ourselves every man conscience sight God even if our gospel veiled veiled those who perishing god this age has blinded minds unbelievers so they cannot see light gospel glory Christ who image God we do not proclaim ourselves but Jesus Christ Lord ourselves your servants Jesus sake God who said Let light shine out darkness made His light shine our hearts give us light knowledge glory God face Jesus Christ Now we have this treasure jars clay show this surpassingly great power from God not from us We hard pressed on all sides but not crushed perplexed but not despair persecuted but not forsaken struck down but not destroyed We always carry around our body death Jesus so life Jesus may also revealed our body we who alive always consigned death Jesus sake so life Jesus may also revealed our mortal body So then death work us but life work you keeping what written I believed therefore I have spoken we who have same spirit faith also believe therefore speak knowing One who raised Lord Jesus will also raise us Jesus present us you His presence All this your benefit so grace extending more more people may overflow thanksgiving glory God Therefore we do not lose heart Though our outer self wasting away yet our inner self being renewed day by day our light momentary affliction producing us eternal weight glory far beyond comparison So we fix our eyes not on what seen but on what unseen what seen temporary but what unseen eternal Now we know if earthly tent we live dismantled we have building from God eternal house heaven not built by human hands this tent we groan longing clothed our heavenly dwelling because when we clothed we will not found naked So while we this tent we groan under our burdens because we do not wish unclothed but clothed so our mortality may swallowed up by life God has prepared us this very purpose has given us Spirit pledge what come Therefore we always confident although we know while we home body we away from Lord we walk by faith not by sight We confident then would prefer away from body home Lord So we aspire please Him whether we here this body or away from we must all appear before judgment seat Christ each one may receive his due things done body whether good or bad Therefore since we know what means fear Lord we try persuade men What we clear God I hope clear your conscience well We not commending ourselves you again Instead we giving you occasion proud us so you can answer those who take pride appearances rather than heart If we out our mind God if we sound mind you Christ love compels us because we convinced One died all therefore all died He died all those who live should no longer live themselves but Him who died them raised again So from now on we regard no one according flesh Although we once regarded Christ this way we do so no longer Therefore if anyone Christ he new creation old has passed away Behold new has come All this from God who reconciled us Himself through Christ gave us ministry reconciliation God reconciling world Himself Christ not counting men trespasses against them He has committed us message reconciliation Therefore we ambassadors Christ though God making His appeal through us We implore you on behalf Christ reconciled God God made Him who knew no sin sin on our behalf so Him we might become righteousness God God fellow workers then we urge you not receive God grace vain He says time favor I heard you day salvation I helped you Behold now time favor now day salvation We put no obstacle anyone way so no one can discredit our ministry Rather servants God we commend ourselves every way great endurance troubles hardships calamities beatings imprisonments riots labor sleepless nights hunger purity knowledge patience kindness Holy Spirit sincere love truthful speech power God weapons righteousness right hand left through glory dishonor slander praise viewed imposters yet genuine unknown yet well known dying yet we live on punished yet not killed sorrowful yet always rejoicing poor yet making many rich having nothing yet possessing everything We have spoken freely you Corinthians Our hearts open wide not our affection but yours restrained fair exchange I ask you my children Open wide your hearts also Do not unequally yoked unbelievers what partnership can righteousness have wickedness Or what fellowship does light have darkness What harmony there between Christ Belial Or what does believer have common unbeliever What agreement can exist between temple God idols we temple living God God has said I will dwell them walk among them I will their God they will My people Therefore come out from among them separate says Lord Touch no unclean thing I will receive you I will Father you you will My sons daughters says Lord Almighty Therefore beloved since we have these promises let us cleanse ourselves from everything defiles body spirit perfecting holiness fear God Make room us your hearts We have wronged no one we have corrupted no one we have exploited no one I do not say this condemn you I have said before you so occupy our hearts we live die together you Great my confidence you great my pride you I am filled encouragement all our troubles my joy overflows when we arrived Macedonia our bodies had no rest but we pressed from every direction conflicts on outside fears within But God who comforts downcast comforted us by arrival Titus not only by his arrival but also by comfort he had received from you He told us about your longing your mourning your zeal me so I rejoiced all more Even if I caused you sorrow by my letter I do not regret Although I did regret I now see my letter caused you sorrow but only short time now I rejoice not because you made sorrowful but because your sorrow led you repentance you felt sorrow God had intended so not harmed any way by us Godly sorrow brings repentance leads salvation without regret but worldly sorrow brings death Consider what this godly sorrow has produced you what earnestness what eagerness clear yourselves what indignation what alarm what longing what zeal what vindication every way you have proved yourselves innocent this matter So even though I wrote you not on account one who did wrong or one who harmed but rather your earnestness on our behalf would made clear you sight God On account this we encouraged addition our own

beyond their own accord they earnestly pleaded us privilege sharing this service saints not only did they do we expected but they gave themselves first Lord then us because will God So we urged Titus help complete your act grace just he had started But just you excel everything faith speech knowledge complete earnestness love we inspired you see you also excel this grace giving I am not making demand but I am testing sincerity your love comparison earnestness others you know grace our Lord Jesus Christ though He rich yet your sakes He became poor so you through His poverty might become rich

eagerness there gift acceptable according what one has not according what he does not have not our intention others may relieved while you burdened but there may equality present time your surplus

heart Titus same devotion I have you not only did he welcome our appeal but he eagerly coming you his own volition Along Titus we sending brother who praised by all churches his work gospel More than this brother chosen by churches accompany us offering gracious gift we administer honor Lord Himself show our eagerness help We hope avoid any criticism way we administer this generous gift we taking

tear down arguments every presumption set up against knowledge God we take captive every thought make obedient Christ we will ready punish every act disobedience soon your obedience complete You looking outward appearances If anyone confident he belongs Christ he should remind himself we belong Christ just much he does even if I boast somewhat excessively about authority Lord gave us building you up rather than tearing you down I will not ashamed I do not want seem trying frighten you by my letters some say His letters weighty forceful but his physical presence unimpressive his speaking no account Such people should consider what we our letters when absent we will our actions when present We do not dare classify or compare ourselves some who commend themselves When they measure themselves by themselves compare themselves themselves they show their ignorance We however will not boast beyond our limits but only within field influence God has assigned us field reaches even you We not overstepping our bounds if we had not come you Indeed we first reach you gospel Christ Neither do we boast beyond our limits labors others But we hope your faith increases our area influence among you will greatly increase well so we can preach gospel regions beyond you Then we will not boasting work already done another man territory Rather Let him who boasts boast Lord not one who commends himself who approved but one whom Lord commends I hope you will bear little my foolishness but you already doing I am jealous you godly jealousy I promised you one husband present you pure virgin Christ I am afraid however just Eve deceived by serpent cunning your minds may led astray from your simple pure devotion Christ if someone comes proclaims Jesus other than One we proclaimed or

churches by accepting their support order serve you when I you need I not burden anyone brothers who came from Macedonia supplied my needs I have refrained from being burden you any way I will continue do so surely truth Christ me this boasting mine will not silenced regions Achaia Why Because I do not love you God knows I do But I will keep on doing what I am doing order undercut those who want opportunity regarded our equals things which they boast such men false apostles deceitful workers masquerading apostles Christ no wonder Satan himself masquerades angel light not surprising then if his servants masquerade servants righteousness Their end will correspond their actions I repeat Let no one take me fool But if you do then receive me fool so I too may boast little this confident boasting mine I am not speaking Lord would but fool Since many boasting according flesh I too will boast you gladly tolerate fools since you so wise fact you even put up anyone who enslaves you or exploits you or takes advantage you or exalts himself or strikes you face my shame I concede we too weak Speaking fool however I can match what anyone else dares boast about they Hebrews So am I they

Five times I received from Jews forty lashes minus one Three times I beaten rods once I stoned three times I shipwrecked I spent night day open sea my frequent journeys I have been danger from rivers

these external trials I face daily pressure my concern all churches Who weak I am not weak Who led into sin I do not burn grief If I must boast I will boast things show my weakness God Father Lord Jesus who forever worthy praise knows I am not lying Damascus governor under King Aretas secured city Damascenes order arrest me But I lowered basket through window wall escaped his grasp I must go on boasting Although there nothing gain I will go on visions revelations from Lord I know man Christ who fourteen years ago caught up third heaven Whether body or out I do not know but God knows I know

one another one mind live peace God love peace will you Greet one another holy kiss All saints send you greetings grace Lord Jesus Christ love God fellowship Holy Spirit all you Paul apostle sent not from men nor by man but by Jesus Christ God Father who raised Him from dead all brothers me churches Galatia Grace peace you from God our Father Lord Jesus Christ who gave Himself our sins rescue us from present evil age according will our God Father whom glory forever ever Amen I am amazed how quickly you deserting One who called you by grace Christ turning different gospel which not even gospel Evidently some people troubling you trying distort gospel Christ But even if we or angel from heaven should preach gospel contrary one we preached you let him under curse we have said before so now I say again If anyone preaching you gospel contrary one you received let him under curse Am I now seeking approval men or God Or am I striving please men If I still trying please men I would not servant Christ I certify you brothers gospel I preached not devised by man I did not receive from any man nor I taught rather I received by revelation from Jesus Christ you have heard my former way life Judaism how severely I persecuted church God tried destroy I advancing Judaism beyond many my contemporaries extremely zealous traditions my fathers But when God who set me apart from my mother womb called me by His grace pleased reveal His Son me so I might preach Him among Gentiles I did not rush consult flesh blood nor did I go up Jerusalem apostles who came before me but I went into Arabia later returned Damascus Only after three years did I go up Jerusalem confer Cephas I stayed him fifteen days But I saw none other apostles except James Lord brother I assure you before God what I am writing you no lie Later I went regions Syria Cilicia I personally unknown however churches Judea Christ They only heard account man who formerly persecuted us now preaching faith he once tried destroy they glorified God because me Fourteen years later I went up again Jerusalem accompanied by Barnabas I took Titus along also I went response revelation set before them gospel I preach among Gentiles But I spoke privately those recognized leaders fear I running or had already run vain Yet not even Titus who me compelled circumcised even though he Greek This issue arose because some false brothers had come under false pretenses spy on our freedom Christ Jesus order enslave us We did not give them moment so truth gospel would remain you But highly esteemed whatever they makes no difference me God does not show favoritism those leaders added nothing me On contrary they saw I had been entrusted preach gospel uncircumcised just Peter had been circumcised One who work Peter apostleship circumcised also work my apostleship Gentiles recognizing grace I had been given James Cephas Johnthose reputed pillars gave me Barnabas right hand fellowship so we should go Gentiles they circumcised They only asked us remember poor very thing I eager do When Cephas came Antioch however I opposed him his face because he stood condemned before certain men came from James he used eat Gentiles But when they arrived he began draw back separate himself fear those circumcision group other Jews joined him his hypocrisy so by their hypocrisy even Barnabas led astray When I saw they not walking line truth gospel I said Cephas front them all If you who Jew live like Gentile not like Jew how can you compel Gentiles live like Jews We who Jews by birth not Gentile sinners know man not justified by works law but by faith Jesus Christ So we too have believed Christ Jesus we may justified by faith Christ not by works law because by works law no one will justified But if while we seek justified Christ we ourselves found sinners does make Christ minister sin Certainly not If I rebuild what I have already torn down I prove myself lawbreaker through law I died law so I might live God I have been crucified Christ I no longer live but Christ lives me life I live body I live by faith Son God who loved me gave Himself up me I do not set aside grace God if righteousness comes through law Christ died nothing O foolish Galatians Who has bewitched you Before your very eyes Jesus Christ clearly portrayed crucified I would like learn just one thing from you Did you receive Spirit by works law or by hearing faith you so foolish After starting Spirit you now finishing flesh Have you suffered so much nothing if really nothing Does God lavish His Spirit on you work miracles among you because you practice law or because you hear believe So also Abraham believed God credited him righteousness Understand then those who have faith sons Abraham Scripture foresaw God would justify Gentiles by faith foretold gospel Abraham All nations will blessed through you So those who have faith blessed along Abraham man faith All who rely on works law under curse written Cursed everyone who does not continue do everything written Book Law Now clear no one justified before God by law because righteous will live by faith law however not based on faith on contrary man who does these things will live by them Christ redeemed us from curse law by becoming curse us written Cursed everyone who hung on tree He redeemed us order blessing promised Abraham would come Gentiles Christ Jesus so by faith we might receive promise Spirit Brothers let me put this human terms Even human covenant once ratified cannot canceled or amended promises spoken Abraham his seed Scripture does not say seeds meaning many but your seed meaning One who Christ What I mean this law came 430 years later does not revoke covenant previously established by God so nullify promise if inheritance depends on law then no longer depends on promise but God freely granted Abraham through promise Why then law given added because transgressions until arrival seed whom promise referred administered through angels by mediator mediator unnecessary however only one party but God one law then opposed promises God Certainly not if law had been given could impart life then righteousness would certainly have come from law But Scripture pronounces all things confined by sin so by faith Jesus Christ promise might given those who believe Before this faith came we held custody under law locked up until faith should revealed So law became our guardian lead us Christ we might justified by faith Now faith has come we no longer under guardian You all sons God through faith Christ Jesus all you who baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves Christ There neither Jew nor Greek slave nor free male nor female you all one Christ Jesus if you belong Christ then you Abraham seed heirs according promise What I am saying long heir child he no different from slave although he owner everything He subject guardians trustees until date set by his father So also when we children we enslaved under basic principles world But when time had fully come God sent His Son born woman born under law redeem those under law we might receive our adoption sons because you sons God sent Spirit His Son into our hearts crying out Abba Father So you no longer slave but son since you son you also heir through God Formerly when you did not know God you slaves those who by nature not gods But now you know God or rather known by God how you turning back those weak worthless principles Do you wish enslaved by them all over again You observing special days months seasons years I fear you my efforts you may have been vain I beg you brothers become like me I became like you You have done me no wrong You know because illness I first preached gospel you although my illness trial you you did not despise or reject me Instead you welcomed me if I angel God if I Christ Jesus Himself What then has become your blessing I can testify if possible you would have torn out your eyes given them me Have I now become your enemy by telling you truth Those people zealous you but not good way Instead they want isolate you from us so you may zealous them Nevertheless good zealous if serves noble purpose any time not only when I am you My children whom I am again pains childbirth until Christ formed you how I wish I could you now change my tone because I am perplexed about you Tell me you who want under law do you not understand what law says written Abraham had two sons one by slave woman other by free woman His son by slave woman born according flesh but his son by free woman born through promise These things serve illustrations women represent two covenants One covenant from Mount Sinai bears children into slavery This Hagar Now Hagar stands Mount Sinai Arabia corresponds present day Jerusalem because she slavery her children But Jerusalem above free she our mother written Rejoice O barren woman who bears no children break forth cry aloud you who have never travailed because more children desolate woman than her who has husband Now you brothers like Isaac children promise time however son born by flesh persecuted son born by Spirit same now But what does Scripture say Expel slave woman her son slave woman son will never share inheritance free woman son Therefore brothers we not children slave woman but free woman freedom Christ has set us free Stand firm then do not encumbered once more by yoke slavery Take notice I Paul tell you if you let yourselves circumcised Christ will no value you all Again I testify every man who gets himself circumcised he obligated obey whole law You who trying justified by law have been severed from Christ you have fallen away from grace But by faith we eagerly await through Spirit hope righteousness Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has any value All matters faith expressed through love You running so well Who has obstructed you from obeying truth Such persuasion does not come from One who calls you little leaven works through whole batch dough I am confident Lord you will take no other view one who troubling you will bear judgment whoever he may Now brothers if I am still preaching circumcision why am I still being persecuted case offense cross has been abolished those who agitating you I wish they would proceed emasculate themselves you brothers called freedom but do not use your freedom opportunity flesh Rather serve one another love entire law fulfilled single decree Love your neighbor yourself But if you keep on biting devouring one another watch out or you will consumed by one another So I say walk by Spirit you will not gratify desires flesh flesh craves what contrary Spirit Spirit what contrary flesh They opposed each other so you do not do what you want But if you led by Spirit you not under law acts flesh obvious sexual immorality impurity debauchery idolatry sorcery hatred discord jealousy rage rivalries divisions factions envy drunkenness orgies like I warn you I did before those who practice such things will not inherit kingdom God But fruit Spirit love joy peace patience kindness goodness faithfulness gentleness self control Against such things there no law Those who belong Christ Jesus have crucified flesh its passions desires Since we live by Spirit let us walk step Spirit Let us not become conceited provoking envying one another Brothers if someone caught trespass you who spiritual should restore him spirit gentleness But watch yourself or you also may tempted Carry one another burdens this way you will fulfill law Christ If anyone thinks he something when he nothing he deceives himself Each one should test his own work Then he will have reason boast himself alone not someone else each one should carry his own load Nevertheless one who receives instruction word must share all good things his instructor Do not deceived God not mocked Whatever man sows he will reap return one who sows please his flesh from flesh will reap destruction but one who sows please Spirit from Spirit will reap eternal life Let us not grow weary well doing due time we will reap harvest if we do not give up Therefore we have opportunity let us do good everyone especially family faith See what large letters I am using write you my own hand Those who want make good impression outwardly trying compel you circumcised They only do this avoid persecution cross Christ circumcised do not even keep law themselves yet they want you circumcised they may boast your flesh But me may I never boast except cross our Lord Jesus Christ through which world has been crucified me I world neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything What counts new creation Peace mercy all who walk by this rule even Israel God From now on let no one cause me trouble I bear on my body marks Jesus grace our Lord Jesus Christ your spirit brothers Amen Paul apostle Christ Jesus by will God saints Ephesus faithful Christ Jesus Grace peace you from God our Father Lord Jesus Christ

Him heavenly realms Christ Jesus order coming ages He might display surpassing riches His grace demonstrated by His kindness us Christ Jesus by grace you have been saved through faith this not from yourselves gift God not by works so no one can boast we God workmanship created Christ Jesus do good works which God prepared advance our way life Therefore remember formerly you who Gentiles flesh called uncircumcised by so called circumcision done body by human hands remember time you separate from Christ alienated from commonwealth Israel strangers covenants promise without hope without God world But now Christ Jesus you who once far away have been brought near through blood Christ He Himself our peace who has made two one has torn down dividing wall hostility by abolishing His flesh law

times every way Lord all you This greeting my own hand Paul This my mark every letter way I write grace our Lord Jesus Christ all you Paul apostle Christ Jesus by command God our Savior Christ Jesus our hope Timothy my true child faith Grace mercy peace from God Father Christ Jesus our Lord I urged you on my departure Macedonia you should stay on Ephesus instruct certain men not teach false doctrines or devote themselves myths endless genealogies which promote speculation rather than stewardship God work which by faith goal our instruction love comes from pure heart clear conscience sincere faith Some have strayed from these ways turned aside empty talk They want teachers law but they do not understand what they saying or which they so confidently assert Now we know law good if one uses legitimately We realize law not enacted righteous but lawless rebellious ungodly sinful unholy profane killers father or mother murderers sexually immoral homosexuals slave traders liars perjurers anyone else who averse sound teaching agrees glorious gospel blessed God which I have been entrusted I thank Christ Jesus our Lord who has strengthened me He considered me faithful appointed me service I formerly blasphemer persecutor violent man yet because I had acted ignorance unbelief I shown mercy grace our Lord overflowed me along faith love Christ Jesus This trustworthy saying worthy full acceptance Christ Jesus came into world save sinners whom I am worst But this very reason I shown mercy so me worst sinners Christ Jesus might display His perfect patience example those who would believe Him eternal life Now King eternal immortal invisible only God honor glory forever ever Amen Timothy my child I entrust you this command keeping previous prophecies about you so by them you may fight good fight holding on faith good conscience which some have rejected thereby shipwrecked their faith Among them Hymenaeus Alexander whom I have handed over Satan taught not blaspheme First all then I urge petitions prayers intercessions thanksgiving offered everyone kings all those authority so we may lead tranquil quiet lives all godliness dignity This good pleasing sight God our Savior who wants everyone saved come knowledge truth there one God there one mediator between God men man Christ Jesus who gave Himself ransom all testimony given just right time this reason I appointed preacher apostle faithful true teacher Gentiles I am telling truth I am not lying about anything Therefore I want men everywhere pray lifting up holy hands without anger or dissension Likewise I want women adorn themselves respectable apparel modesty self control not braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive clothes but good deeds proper women who profess worship God woman must learn quietness full submissiveness I do not permit woman teach or exercise authority over man she remain quiet Adam formed first then Eve not Adam who deceived but woman who deceived fell into transgression Women however will saved through childbearing if they continue faith love holiness self control This trustworthy saying If anyone aspires overseer he desires noble task overseer then must above reproach husband but one wife temperate self controlled respectable hospitable able teach not dependent on wine not violent but gentle peaceable free love money overseer must manage his own household well keep his children under control complete dignity if someone does not know how manage his own household how can he care church God He must not recent convert or he may become conceited fall under same condemnation devil Furthermore he must have good reputation outsiders so he will not fall into disgrace into snare devil Deacons likewise must dignified not double tongued or given much wine or greedy money They must hold mystery faith clear conscience Additionally they must first tested Then if they above reproach let them serve deacons same way women must dignified not slanderers but temperate faithful all things deacon must husband but one wife good manager his children his own household those who have served well deacons acquire themselves high standing great confidence faith Christ Jesus Although I hope come you soon I am writing you these things case I am delayed so you will know how each one must conduct himself God household which church living God pillar foundation truth By common confession mystery godliness great He appeared flesh vindicated by Spirit seen by angels proclaimed among nations believed throughout world taken up glory Now Spirit expressly states later times some will abandon faith follow deceitful spirits teachings demons influenced by hypocrisy liars whose consciences seared hot iron They will prohibit marriage require abstinence from certain foods God has created received thanksgiving by those who believe know truth every creation God good nothing received thanksgiving should rejected because sanctified by word God prayer By pointing out these things brothers you will good servant Christ Jesus nourished by words faith sound instruction you have followed But reject irreverent silly myths Instead train yourself godliness physical exercise limited value but godliness valuable every way holding promise present life one come This trustworthy saying worthy full acceptance this end we labor strive because we have set our hope on living God who Savior everyone especially those who believe Command teach these things Let no one despise your youth but set example believers speech conduct love faith purity Until I come devote yourself public reading Scripture exhortation teaching Do not neglect gift you which given you through prophecy spoken over you laying on hands elders diligent these matters absorbed them so your progress will evident all Pay close attention your life your teaching Persevere these things by so doing you will save both yourself those who hear you Do not rebuke older man but appeal him father Treat younger men brothers older women mothers younger women sisters absolute purity Honor widows who truly widows But if widow has children or grandchildren they must first learn show godliness their own family repay their parents this pleasing sight God widow who truly need left all alone puts her hope God continues night day her petitions prayers But she who lives pleasure dead even while she still alive Give these instructions believers so they will above reproach If anyone does not provide his own especially his own household he has denied faith worse than unbeliever widow should enrolled if she least sixty years old wife one man well known good deeds such bringing up children entertaining strangers washing feet saints imparting relief afflicted devoting herself every good work But refuse enroll younger widows when their passions draw them away from Christ they will want marry thus will incur judgment because they setting aside their first faith same time they will also learn idle going from house house being not only idle but also gossips busybodies discussing things they should not mention So I advise younger widows marry have children manage their households denying adversary occasion slander some have already turned aside follow Satan If any believing woman has dependent widows she must assist them not allow church burdened so can help widows who truly need Elders who lead effectively worthy double honor especially those who work hard preaching teaching Scripture says Do not muzzle ox while treading out grain worker worthy his wages Do not entertain accusation against elder except on testimony two or three witnesses But those who persist sin should rebuked front everyone so others will stand fear sin I solemnly charge you before God Christ Jesus

I am sending back you him who my very heart I would have liked keep him me so on your behalf he could minister me my chains gospel But I did not want do anything without your consent so your goodness

beloved me but even more so you both person Lord So if you consider me partner receive him you would receive me But if he has wronged you any way or owes you anything charge my account I Paul write

even more than I ask meantime prepare guest room me because I hope through your prayers I will restored you Epaphras my fellow prisoner Christ Jesus sends you greetings do Mark Aristarchus Demas Luke my fellow workers grace Lord Jesus Christ your spirit On many past occasions many different ways God spoke our fathers through prophets But these last days He has spoken us by His Son whom He appointed heir all things through whom He made universe Son radiance God glory exact representation His nature upholding all things by His powerful word After He had provided purification sins He sat down right hand Majesty on high So He became far superior angels name He has inherited excellent beyond theirs which angels did God ever say You My Son today I have become Your Father Or again I will His Father He will My Son again when God brings His firstborn into world He says Let all God angels worship Him Now about angels He says He makes His angels winds His servants flames fire But about Son He says Your throne O God endures forever ever justice scepter Your kingdom You have loved righteousness hated wickedness therefore God Your God has anointed You above Your companions oil joy beginning O Lord You laid foundations earth heavens work Your hands They will perish but You remain they will all wear out like garment You will roll them up like robe like garment they will changed but You remain same Your years will never end Yet which angels did God ever say Sit My right hand until I make Your enemies footstool Your feet not angels ministering spirits sent serve those who will inherit salvation We must pay closer attention therefore what we have heard so we do not drift away if message spoken by angels binding every transgression disobedience received its just punishment how shall we escape if we neglect such great salvation This salvation first announced by Lord confirmed us by those who heard Him affirmed by God through signs wonders various miracles gifts Holy Spirit distributed according His will not angels He has subjected world come about which we speaking But somewhere testified these words What man You mindful him or son man You care him You made him little lower than angels You crowned him glory honor placed everything under his feet When God subjected all things him He left nothing outside his control Yet present we do not see everything subject him But we see Jesus who made little lower than angels now crowned glory honor because He suffered death so by grace God He might taste death everyone bringing many sons glory fitting God whom through whom all things exist make author their salvation perfect through suffering both One who sanctifies those who sanctified same family So Jesus not ashamed call them brothers He says I will proclaim Your name My brothers I will sing Your praises assembly again I will put My trust Him once again Here am I children God has given Me Now since children have flesh blood He too shared their humanity so by His death He might destroy him who holds power death devil free those who all their lives held slavery by their fear death surely not angels He helps but descendants Abraham this reason He had made like His brothers every way so He might become merciful faithful high priest service God order make atonement sins people Because He Himself suffered when He tempted He able help those who being tempted Therefore holy brothers who share heavenly calling set your focus on Jesus apostle high priest whom we confess He faithful One who appointed Him just Moses faithful all God house Jesus has been counted worthy greater glory than Moses just builder house has greater honor than house itself every house built by someone but God builder everything Now Moses faithful servant all God house testifying what would spoken later But Christ faithful Son over God house we His house if we hold firmly our confidence hope which we boast Therefore Holy Spirit says Today if you hear His voice do not harden your hearts you did rebellion day testing wilderness where your fathers tested tried Me forty years saw My works Therefore I angry generation I said Their hearts always going astray they have not known My ways So I swore on oath My anger They shall never enter My rest See brothers none you has wicked heart unbelief turns away from living God But exhort one another daily long called today so none you may hardened by sin deceitfulness We have come share Christ if we hold firmly end assurance we had first has been said Today if you hear His voice do not harden your hearts you did rebellion who ones who heard rebelled they not all those Moses led out Egypt whom God angry forty years not those who sinned whose bodies fell wilderness whom did He swear they would never enter His rest not those who disobeyed So we see because their unbelief they unable enter Therefore while promise entering His rest still stands let us careful none you deemed have fallen short we also received good news just they did but message they heard no value them since they did not share faith those who comprehended Now we who have believed enter rest others just God has said So I swore on oath My anger They shall never enter My rest yet His works have been finished since foundation world somewhere He has spoken about seventh day this manner on seventh day God rested from all His works again He says passage above They shall never enter My rest Since then remains some enter His rest since those who formerly heard good news did not enter because their disobedience God again designated certain day Today when long time later He spoke through David just stated Today if you hear His voice do not harden your hearts if Joshua had given them rest God would not have spoken later about another day There remains then Sabbath rest people God whoever enters God rest also rests from his own work just God did from His Let us therefore make every effort enter rest so no one will fall by following same pattern disobedience word God living active Sharper than any double edged sword pierces even dividing soul spirit joints marrow judges thoughts intentions heart Nothing all creation hidden from God sight everything uncovered exposed before eyes Him whom we must give account Therefore since we have great high priest who has passed through heavens Jesus Son God let us hold firmly what we profess we do not have high priest who unable sympathize our weaknesses but we have one who tempted every way we yet without sin Let us then approach throne grace confidence so we may receive mercy find grace help us our time need Every high priest appointed from among men represent them matters relating God offer gifts sacrifices sins He able deal gently those who ignorant misguided since he himself beset by weakness why he obligated offer sacrifices his own sins well sins people No one takes this honor upon himself he must called by God just Aaron So also Christ did not take upon Himself glory becoming high priest but He called by One who said Him You My Son today I have become Your Father another passage God says You priest forever order Melchizedek During days Jesus earthly life He offered up prayers petitions loud cries tears One who could save Him from death He heard because His reverence Although He Son He learned obedience from what He suffered having been made perfect He became source eternal salvation all who obey Him designated by God high priest order Melchizedek We have much say about this but hard explain because you dull hearing Although by this time you ought teachers you need someone reteach you basic principles God word You need milk not solid food everyone who lives on milk still infant inexperienced message righteousness But solid food mature who by constant use have trained their senses distinguish good from evil Therefore let us leave elementary teachings about Christ go on maturity not laying again foundation repentance from dead works faith God instruction about baptisms laying on hands resurrection dead eternal judgment this we will do if God permits impossible those who have once been enlightened who have tasted heavenly gift who have shared Holy Spirit who have tasted goodness word God powers coming age then have fallen away restored repentance because they themselves crucifying Son God all over again subjecting Him open shame land drinks rain often falling on produces crop useful those whom tended receives blessing God But land produces thorns thistles worthless its curse imminent end will burned Even though we speak like this beloved we convinced better things your case things accompany salvation God not unjust He will not forget your work love you have shown His name you have ministered saints continue do so We want each you show this same diligence very end order make your hope sure Then you will not sluggish but will imitate those who through faith patience inherit what has been promised When God made His promise Abraham since He had no one greater swear by He swore by Himself saying I will surely bless you multiply your descendants so Abraham after waiting patiently obtained promise Men swear by someone greater than themselves their oath serves confirmation end all argument So when God wanted make unchanging nature His purpose very clear heirs promise He guaranteed oath Thus by two unchangeable things which impossible God lie we who have fled take hold hope set before us may strongly encouraged We have this hope anchor soul firm secure enters inner sanctuary behind curtain where Jesus our forerunner has entered on our behalf He has become high priest forever order Melchizedek This Melchizedek king Salem priest God Most High He met Abraham returning from slaughter kings blessed him Abraham apportioned him tenth everything First his name means king righteousness Then also king Salem means king peace Without father or mother or genealogy without beginning days or end life like Son God he remains priest all time Consider how great Melchizedek Even patriarch Abraham gave him tenth plunder Now law commands sons Levi who become priests collect tenth from people from their brothers though they too descended from Abraham But Melchizedek who did not trace his descent from Levi collected tenth from Abraham blessed him who had promises indisputably lesser blessed by greater case Levites mortal men collect tenth but case Melchizedek affirmed he lives on so speak Levi who collects tenth paid tenth through Abraham when Melchizedek met Abraham Levi still loin his ancestor Now if perfection could have been attained through Levitical priesthood on this basis people received law why there still need another priest appear one order Melchizedek not order Aaron when priesthood changed law must changed well He whom these things said belonged different tribe from which no one has ever served altar clear our Lord descended from Judah tribe which Moses said nothing about priests this point even more clear if another priest like Melchizedek appears one who has become priest not by law succession but by power indestructible life testified You priest forever order Melchizedek So former commandment set aside because weak useless law made nothing perfect better hope introduced by which we draw near God none this happened without oath others became priests without oath but Jesus became priest oath by One who said Him Lord has sworn will not change His mind You priest forever Because this oath Jesus has become guarantee better covenant Now there have been many other priests since death prevented them from continuing office But because Jesus lives forever He has permanent priesthood Therefore He able save completely those who draw near God through Him since He always lives intercede them Such high priest truly befits us One who holy innocent undefiled set apart from sinners exalted above heavens Unlike other high priests He does not need offer daily sacrifices first His own sins then sins people He sacrificed sin once all when He offered up Himself law appoints high priests men who weak but oath which came after law appointed Son who has been made perfect forever point what we saying this We do have such high priest who sat down right hand throne Majesty heaven who ministers sanctuary true tabernacle set up by Lord not by man since every high priest appointed offer both gifts sacrifices necessary this One also have something offer Now if He on earth He would not priest since there already priests who offer gifts according law place where they serve copy shadow what heaven This why Moses warned when he about build tabernacle See you make everything according pattern shown you on mountain Now however Jesus has received much more excellent ministry just covenant He mediates better founded on better promises if first covenant had been without fault no place would have been sought second But God found fault people said Behold days coming declares Lord when I will make new covenant house Israel house Judah will not like covenant I made their fathers when I took them by hand lead them out land Egypt because they did not abide by My covenant I disregarded them declares Lord this covenant I will make house Israel after those days declares Lord I will put My laws their minds inscribe them on their hearts I will their God they will My people No longer will each one teach his neighbor or his brother saying Know Lord because they will all know Me from least them greatest I will forgive their iniquities will remember their sins no more By speaking new covenant He has made first one obsolete what obsolete aging will soon disappear Now first covenant had regulations worship also earthly sanctuary tabernacle prepared its first room lampstand table consecrated bread This called Holy Place Behind second curtain room called Most Holy Place containing golden altar incense gold covered ark covenant Inside ark gold jar manna Aaron staff had budded stone tablets covenant Above ark cherubim glory overshadowing mercy seat But we cannot discuss these things detail now When everything had been prepared this way priests entered regularly into first room perform their sacred duties But only high priest entered second room then only once year never without blood which he offered himself sins people had committed ignorance By this arrangement Holy Spirit showing way into Most Holy Place had not yet been disclosed long first tabernacle still standing illustration present time because gifts sacrifices being offered unable cleanse conscience worshiper They consist only food drink special washings external regulations imposed until time reform But when Christ came high priest good things have come He went through greater more perfect tabernacle not made by hands not part this creation He did not enter by blood goats calves but He entered Most Holy Place once all by His own blood thus securing eternal redemption if blood goats bulls ashes heifer sprinkled on those who ceremonially unclean sanctify them so their bodies clean how much more will blood Christ who through eternal Spirit offered Himself unblemished God purify our consciences from works death so we may serve living God Therefore Christ mediator new covenant so those who called may receive promised eternal inheritance now He has died redeem them from transgressions committed under first covenant case will necessary establish death one who made because will does not take effect until one who made has died cannot executed while he still alive why even first covenant not put into effect without blood when Moses had proclaimed every commandment law all people he took blood calves goats along water scarlet wool hyssop sprinkled scroll all people saying This blood covenant which God has commanded you keep same way he sprinkled blood tabernacle all vessels used worship According law fact nearly everything must purified blood without shedding blood there no forgiveness So necessary copies heavenly things purified these sacrifices but heavenly things themselves better sacrifices than these Christ did not enter man made copy true sanctuary but He entered heaven itself now appear on our behalf presence God Nor did He enter heaven offer Himself again again high priest enters Most Holy Place every year blood not his own Otherwise Christ would have had suffer repeatedly since foundation world But now He has appeared once all end ages do away sin by sacrifice Himself Just man appointed die once after face judgment so also Christ offered once bear sins many He will appear second time not bear sin but bring salvation those who eagerly await Him law only shadow good things come not realities themselves can never by same sacrifices offered year after year make perfect those who draw near worship If could would not offerings have ceased worshipers would have been cleansed once all would no longer have felt guilt their sins Instead those sacrifices annual reminder sins because impossible blood bulls goats take away sins Therefore when Christ came into world He said Sacrifice offering You did not desire but body You prepared Me burnt offerings sin offerings You took no delight Then I said Here I am written about Me scroll I have come do Your will O God passage above He says Sacrifices offerings burnt offerings sin offerings You did not desire nor did You delight them although they offered according law Then He adds Here I am I have come do Your will He takes away first establish second by will we have been sanctified through sacrifice body Jesus Christ once all Day after day every priest stands minister offer again again same sacrifices which can never take away sins But when this Priest had offered all time one sacrifice sins He sat down right hand God Since time He waits His enemies made footstool His feet because by single offering He has made perfect all time those who being sanctified Holy Spirit also testifies us about this First He says This covenant I will make them after those days declares Lord I will put My laws their hearts inscribe them on their minds Then He adds Their sins lawless acts I will remember no more where these have been forgiven offering sin no longer needed Therefore brothers since we have confidence enter Most Holy Place by blood Jesus by new living way opened us through curtain His body since we have great priest over house God let us draw near sincere heart full assurance faith having our hearts sprinkled cleanse us from guilty conscience our bodies washed pure water Let us hold resolutely hope we profess He who promised faithful let us consider how spur one another on love good deeds Let us not neglect meeting together some have made habit but let us encourage one another all more you see Day approaching If we deliberately go on sinning after we have received knowledge truth no further sacrifice sins remains but only fearful expectation judgment raging fire will consume all adversaries Anyone who rejected law Moses died without mercy on testimony two or three witnesses How much more severely do you think one deserves punished who has trampled on Son God profaned blood covenant sanctified him insulted Spirit grace we know Him who said Vengeance Mine I will repay again Lord will judge His people fearful thing fall into hands living God Remember early days you light those days you endured great conflict face suffering Sometimes you publicly exposed ridicule persecution other times you partners those who so treated You sympathized those prison joyfully accepted confiscation your property knowing you yourselves had better permanent possession So do not throw away your confidence holds great reward You need persevere so after you have done will God you will receive what He has promised just little while He who coming will come will not delay But My righteous one will live by faith if he shrinks back I will take no pleasure him But we not those who shrink back destroyed but those who have faith preserve their souls Now faith assurance what we hope certainty what we do not see This why ancients commended By faith we understand universe formed God command so what seen not made out what visible By faith Abel offered God better sacrifice than Cain did By faith he commended righteous when God gave approval his gifts by faith he still speaks even though he dead By faith Enoch taken up so he did not see death He could not found because God had taken him away before he taken he commended one who pleased God without faith impossible please God because anyone who approaches Him must believe He exists He rewards those who earnestly seek Him By faith Noah when warned about things not yet seen godly fear built ark save his family By faith he condemned world became heir righteousness comes by faith By faith Abraham when called go place he would later receive his inheritance obeyed went without knowing where he going By faith he dwelt promised land stranger foreign country He lived tents did Isaac Jacob who heirs him same promise he looking forward city foundations whose architect builder God By faith Sarah even though she barren beyond proper age enabled conceive child because she considered Him faithful who had promised so from one man he good dead came descendants numerous stars sky countless sand on seashore All these people died faith without having received things they promised However they saw them welcomed them from afar they acknowledged they strangers exiles on earth Now those who say such things show they seeking country their own If they had been thinking country they had left they would have had opportunity return Instead they longing better country heavenly one Therefore God not ashamed called their God He has prepared city them By faith Abraham when he tested offered up Isaac on altar He who had received promises ready offer his one only son even though God had said him Through Isaac your offspring will reckoned Abraham reasoned God could raise dead sense he did receive Isaac back from death By faith Isaac blessed Jacob Esau concerning future By faith Jacob when he dying blessed each Joseph sons worshiped he leaned on top his staff By faith Joseph when his end near spoke about exodus Israelites gave instructions about his bones By faith Moses parents hid him three months after his birth because they saw he beautiful child they unafraid king edict By faith Moses when he grown refused called son Pharaoh daughter He chose suffer oppression God people rather than experience fleeting enjoyment sin He valued disgrace Christ above treasures Egypt he looking ahead his reward By faith Moses left Egypt not fearing king anger he persevered because he saw Him who invisible By faith he kept Passover sprinkling blood so destroyer firstborn would not touch Israel own firstborn By faith people passed through Red Sea on dry land but when Egyptians tried follow they drowned By faith walls Jericho fell after people had marched around them seven days By faith prostitute Rahab because she welcomed spies peace did not perish those who disobedient what more shall I say Time will not allow me tell Gideon Barak Samson Jephthah David Samuel prophets who through faith conquered kingdoms administered justice gained what promised who shut mouths lions quenched raging fire escaped edge sword who gained strength from weakness became mighty battle put foreign armies flight Women received back their dead raised life again Others tortured refused their release so they might gain better resurrection Still others endured mocking flogging even chains imprisonment They stoned they sawed two they put death by sword They went around sheepskins goatskins destitute oppressed mistreated world not worthy them They wandered deserts mountains hid caves holes ground These all commended their faith yet they did not receive what promised God had planned something better us so together us they would made perfect Therefore since we surrounded by such great cloud witnesses let us throw off every encumbrance sin so easily entangles let us run endurance race set out us Let us fix our eyes on Jesus author perfecter our faith who joy set before Him endured cross scorning its shame sat down right hand throne God Consider Him who endured such hostility from sinners so you will not grow weary lose heart your struggle against sin you have not yet resisted point shedding your blood you have forgotten exhortation addresses you sons My son do not take lightly discipline Lord do not lose heart when He rebukes you Lord disciplines one He loves He chastises every son He receives Endure suffering discipline God treating you sons what son not disciplined by his father If you do not experience discipline like everyone else then you illegitimate children not true sons Furthermore we have all had earthly fathers who disciplined us we respected them Should we not much more submit Father our spirits live Our fathers disciplined us short time they thought best but God disciplines us our good so we may share His holiness No discipline seems enjoyable time but painful Later on however yields harvest righteousness peace those who have been trained by Therefore strengthen your limp hands weak knees Make straight paths your feet so lame may not disabled but rather healed Pursue peace everyone well holiness without which no one will see Lord See no one falls short grace God no root bitterness springs up cause trouble defile many See no one sexually immoral or godless like Esau who single meal sold his birthright you know afterward when he wanted inherit blessing he rejected He could find no ground repentance though he sought blessing tears you have not come mountain can touched burning fire darkness gloom storm trumpet blast or voice made its hearers beg no further word spoken they could not bear what commanded If even animal touches mountain must stoned sight so terrifying even Moses said I am trembling fear Instead you have come Mount Zion city living God heavenly Jerusalem You have come myriads angels joyful assembly congregation firstborn enrolled heaven You have come God Judge all spirits righteous made perfect Jesus mediator new covenant sprinkled blood speaks better word than blood Abel See you do not refuse Him who speaks if people did not escape when they refused Him who warned them on earth how much less will we escape if we reject Him who warns us from heaven time His voice shook earth but now He has promised Once more I will shake not only earth but heaven well words Once more signify removal what can shakenthat created things so unshakable may remain Therefore since we receiving unshakable kingdom let us filled gratitude so worship God acceptably reverence awe our God consuming fire Continue brotherly love Do not neglect show hospitality strangers by so doing some people have entertained angels without knowing Remember those prison if you bound them those who mistreated if you suffering them Marriage should honored by all marriage bed kept undefiled God will judge sexually immoral adulterers Keep your lives free from love money content what you have God has said Never will I leave you never will I forsake you So we say confidence Lord my helper I will not afraid What can man do me Remember your leaders who spoke word God you Consider outcome their way life imitate their faith Jesus Christ same yesterday today forever Do not carried away by all kinds strange teachings good heart strengthened by grace not by foods no value those devoted them We have altar from which those who serve tabernacle have no right eat Although high priest brings blood animals into Holy Place sacrifice sin bodies burned outside camp so Jesus also suffered outside city gate sanctify people by His own blood Therefore let us go Him outside camp bearing disgrace He bore here we do not have permanent city but we looking city come Through Jesus therefore let us continually offer God sacrifice praise fruit lips confess His name do not neglect do good share others such sacrifices God pleased Obey your leaders submit them they watch over your souls those who must give account this end allow them lead joy not grief would no advantage you Pray us we convinced we have clear conscience desire live honorably every way I especially urge you pray I may restored you soon Now may God peace who through blood eternal covenant

man unstable all his ways brother humble circumstances should exult his high position But one who rich should exult his low position because he will pass away like flower field sun rises scorching heat withers plant its flower falls its beauty lost So too rich man will fade away midst his pursuits Blessed man who perseveres under trial because when he has stood test he will receive crown life God has promised those who love Him When tempted no one should say God tempting me God cannot tempted by evil nor does He tempt anyone But each one tempted when by his own evil desires he lured away
